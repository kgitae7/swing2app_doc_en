# Create a link for a post

## 1. Create a link in Manage posts

**Select a board from → the app Maker V3 page → Step 3 Page → Select the HTML Editor option**

\*If you want to link a post to a board, then first select the board and then link the post to it.

\*If you only want to create a link and copy it to another place, you can select any board.

(Since you are only creating a link, it doesn't matter which board pick to write post)

## 2. How can I use it?

You can link all posts from the link wizard to the board.

If you link directly from a category, you can't link the post directly, so you can import the created link and apply it as a web link.

1\. The generated post link can only be used within the app. It is not an externally available link.

\*This is a link published by an app, so it is different from a regular website link.

2\. The link to the post is only available in the app.

For example, a link to a post created in app A will only be reflected in app A and cannot be applied to app B or app C.

\*Only available in connected apps
