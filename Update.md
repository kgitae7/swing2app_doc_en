A new "Ad Exposure Permission" feature has been added that allows you to specify the extent to which AdMob ads are shown.

<mark style="color:blue;">**What are AdMob ad impressions?**</mark>

App ads created by Swing2App can be set as 'Google AdMob Ads' and are exposed as banner ads and interstitial ads.&#x20;

Ads are exposed to all users who install the app without additional access rights, but if you use the exposure permission, you can set the range in which banner ads and interstitial ads are displayed or not displayed, respectively.&#x20;

Permissions can be added by selecting members registered in the app individually, or by selecting a specific group (member group).&#x20;

Existing admob ads were visible to all users because there was no exposure permission specified.

**The updated AdMob Ad Impression Permissions feature allows app operators to specify AdMob ad coverage to ensure that they are displayed to specific groups or only to certain users depends on the settings.**

If your app has products such as paid memberships within the app, you can set it so the app ads won't be displayed to paid users who purchase memberships.&#x20;

Since ad exposure can interfere with the use of the app, so for VIPs and others, it is possible to remove ads.

In addition, all ads will be displayed to customers who have not signed up, and you can also set not to display ads if you sign up.

In this way, the ad coverage can be set by the operator to suit the purpose of the app.
