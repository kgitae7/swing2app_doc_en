**Swing Store – How to manage a list of items ordered by Order Management**

Order management in the Swing Store is a page where users can view and manage the list of products they have ordered.

If you have a swing store (swing2app shopping mall), you can view and manage your order history and your order information in Swing Store – Order Management.

You can find all the information you have made through your order ID, payment method, delivery information, order status, etc.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*IMPORTANT \* Depending on which item you sell, the pages you’ll need to navigate are different!**</mark>

– Physical Goods Type → Order Management

– Digital Product Type → Digital Order Management

– Go to the Reserved Product Types → Manage Managed Orders menu.

On the physical product order management page, the administrator can manage the order status, change the shipping address, and the courier company.

> For example**, if a user requests a refund for a payment, the item can be changed to a “refund request”.**
>
> Once the refund is complete**, you can change the status of the product to ‘Refund complete’.**
>
> Therefore, the status change for the product that placed the order is the corresponding menu! You can work on the Order Management page.
