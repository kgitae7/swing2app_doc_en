**Product Management-How to Use Product Exposure Management**

The purpose of using the product exposure management is to display the menu on the main page of the shopping mall.

When listing products that you want to show as an event, when promoting your flagship product in a shopping mall, or making a sale or showing a product that is about to run out of stock, you can expose it as a topic.

This menu is available as an option, and is not a choice.

Please check on how to use product exposure management.
