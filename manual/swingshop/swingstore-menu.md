**Do you not like the swing store page – the main page of the shopping mall and the shopping mall information page??**

**Of course! Home screen can be created by applying it to other pages.**&#x20;

If you use the custom page creation tool provided by Swing2App, you can work according to your desired style.

The user page provides the link wizard function (web link, app menu link, etc.), so you can link to the menu created in the swing store.

We’ll show you how to create it through the sample app.

​

<mark style="color:orange;">**1. Using Web Template Pages**</mark>

First of all, we will show you how to link the registered products to each banner (button) using the web template page.

Web template is a user page provided by Swing2App and provides a variety of industry-specific design templates.

Since the design is fully provided, users can only change the text, images, and links.

**In the hotel sample app, the web template is placed on the home screen, and the reservation link is applied to each button to purchase the reservation.**

The image page is also a user page provided by the swing2app, which allows you to link by setting a banner on top of the image.
