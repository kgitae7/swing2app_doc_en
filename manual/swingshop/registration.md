**Swing Store-Product Registration**

If you’ve applied for a swing store, you’ll need to register your product directly at the mall.

Swing2App offers product types – physical, digital, and reservation systems.

\-Physical items are generally sold in shopping malls.

\-Digital includes documents, PDF files, videos, and administrator rights.

\-Reservation system is a date-specific reservation management system for hotels, camping sites, guest houses, etc.

**The manual will show you how to register a physical product, apply it to your app, and more.**

### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP. 1 Register a product category after applying for swing store**</mark>

Please apply for a swing store first. The swing shop must be requested before the menu is available.

**☞** [**How to apply for Swing Shop**](../aff-program/apply.md)

You must apply for a swing store to create a “Swing Store” menu at the top of the app operation page.

When you apply for the swing2app shopping mall, \[swing store] menu is created on the app operation page.
