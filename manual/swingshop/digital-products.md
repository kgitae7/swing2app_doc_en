**How to use the digital product purchase completion page**

We will inform you how to apply the’Digital Product Purchase Completed Page’ among the pages provided by Swing Shop to the app.

**The digital product purchase completion page is a page where you can view purchased content and check digital products.**

**You must apply this page to check the contents of digital goods purchased by users in the app.**

This page must be applied in shopping mall apps that sell digital products.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">\*Digital product sales e.g.) use voucher, coupon, PDF view, video and file, permission change (user level)</mark>



<mark style="color:orange;">**Digital product purchase completion page App execution screen**</mark>



This is the screen of running the Swing Academy sample app.

We sell manual pdf and video files.

When a user purchases the product, they can check the purchased content on the digital product purchase completion page.



<mark style="color:red;">**\*Caution\***</mark>

**The digital product purchase completion page is applicable only for Swing Shop product types-digital product sales.**

For real and reserved products, you can check the purchase history through’My Page’.

In the case of digital products, the purchase completion page is provided only for digital products because the content must be opened and viewed due to the nature of the product.

Please operate it by referring to this point.

<mark style="color:orange;">**TIP to use the digital product purchase completion page**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">\*The page moves differently depending on the type of digital product applied.</mark>

Depending on whether you have purchased a coupon, a usage authorization, or a video file, you will be directed to the page for the product.

If you select the **\[View]** button, you will be directed to the content view, coupon view, order detail page, etc.



<mark style="color:purple;">**If you click the \[View] button,**</mark> you will be taken to the order detail page for checking the contents of the permission usage period.

The usage right is not a product that has a real product like a coupon or view a file like the content, so you will be taken to the order details screen.

**Therefore, please be sure to apply it in shopping mall apps that sell digital products.**&#x20;
