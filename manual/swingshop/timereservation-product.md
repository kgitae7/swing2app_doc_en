Reservation system) How to register date+time reservation products and use the app

**We will tell you how to register and purchase a date/time reservation product from the reservation system.**

**The date and time reservation product can be used to make reservations at specific times of the day (spa massage, restaurant meals, dermatology treatment reservations, etc.).**

Unlike accommodations that make reservations by specifying dates, time reservation products allow you to make reservations by selecting only one day, and you can select the desired time zone.

The date-only reservation system includes the check-in-check-out function, but the function is removed for time reservation products.

Please check the time reservation product registration method, application application, and execution screen through the manual.

**\*Please refer to the manual below for a reservation system that includes multiple days reservation, check-in-check-out functions, like accommodation reservation facilities.**
