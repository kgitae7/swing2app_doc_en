**The reservation system allows you to sell reservation products such as hotels, camping sites and pensions.**&#x20;

**In addition, it is also useful for companies that require reservations-hair shops, nail shops, dermatology, etc.**&#x20;

**The reservation system can set the desired day, time and price for each date.**

**We offer all the options you need for sale.**

**In this manual, we will show you how to register your subscription for the date when the check-in-check-out function is displayed.**
