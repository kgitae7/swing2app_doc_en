Registering swing store products – How to register \[permissions] from digital products

\*For digital sales products-you can select the permission change, PDF, video and file, coupon type.

**We’ll show you how to register your permissions, how to sell them, how to launch your app, and how to use these products.**



<mark style="color:orange;">**What is a digital product ‘permission change’?**</mark>

It is a type of shopping mall that allows users to view the contents by purchasing the rating provided by the app.

For example, VIP customers, premium customers, and top customers are divided into ratings to create products for each level.

Apply content that can be viewed by each grade!

**\*When purchasing VIP permission ☞ All bulletin boards can be read**

**\*When purchasing a premium right ☞ General bulletin boards can be read except VIP board**

**\*When purchasing the right authority ☞ Only the basic information board can be read**

***

<mark style="color:red;">**★ In order to sell rights in the swing store, 2 things must be done first.**</mark>

**1. Set app permissions**

Get a permission first before sale. Should I set a rating on what permissions the app has?

Master permission to view all posts in the app, ratings below that only allow specific bulletin boards… . You must first create a permission level for your apps.

**2. Setting the bulletin board permissions**

Once permissions have been created, you’ll need to set permissions on the bulletin board.

A bulletin board can be viewed by all levels, B bulletin board is visible only to members of the first level, C bulletin board is visible to members 1 to 3 grade, etc ..  Each bulletin board should be rated to access the bulletin board.
