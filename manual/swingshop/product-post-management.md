**Swing Store-How to use the \[Customer Section] menu in Product Management**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Customer section is a page that allows you to check and manage inquiry and product review  of the users listed in the mall app by the customers.**</mark>

This menu is for the administrator page, and the administrator can also check the contents and reply to the product statement.

(In the app, the administrator is not confirmed, so please proceed to the swing2app site page)

In the manual, we will show you how to use the customer section management and how it is actually used in the app.

Let’s first check the product inquiry.

**For product inquiries, users using the shopping mall app can enter an inquiry in the app.**

Then the **administrator can check the user’s inquiries on the page (manage posts) and you can write a reply by clicking the comment.**

<mark style="color:orange;">**Product reviews are also admin pages where you can see reviews that users have written in the app.**</mark>&#x20;

You can check the user’s posts on the app review.

If there is a promotion or malicious comment that is not related to the review, the administrator can delete the post.

You can filter and search by **\[Content and User Name]**.\

<mark style="color:red;">**\[Product review precautions]**</mark>

### <mark style="color:blue;">**3.App launch screen – reviews and queries**</mark>

**Reviews and inquiries can be checked in the sub-menu by selecting the product registered in the shopping mall.**&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**1) Review Screen**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Review and inquiry writing authority can be set in Swing Store – Store Management – Policy Management.**</mark>

Please set whether you want only the members to write or non-members can also write.

I’ve set up a member only for reviews and inquiries.

> **If you select \[Review], you can rate it with a star icon.**
>
> **You can write articles and attach images. When you have finished writing your review, select the \[Write a review] button.**

When the review registration is complete, you can see all the reviews written by other users in the review list.

<mark style="color:blue;">**2) Product inquiry (inquiry screen)**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**3)Secret Writing**</mark>&#x20;

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Group-798@3x.png)

When writing a product, you can choose whether or not to write a secret article.

Secret writing can only be checked by the author and administrator.&#x20;

If you’re looking for something that’s a little embarrassing for others to see, please write a secret article.

In addition, the administrator can enter a response by commenting on the product posts management page.

The app exposes both the content of the inquiry and the answers from the administrator so that you can see it.\
