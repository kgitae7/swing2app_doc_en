**How to Use the Main Page of Swing Shop Shopping Mall**\
&#x20;I’ll show you how to apply the main page that many people use when using Swing Shop.\
The main page is a swing page function that is provided when applying for a swing shop.\
Since the UI template is all set, it can be applied to the home screen and used as the main screen.

This is the app launch screen with the shopping mall main page applied.

Store main images and product thumbnail images are all placed on the screen when you register your store and register your product while using the Swing Shop menu.

Refer to the manual and when using Swing Shop) Please check how to use and apply the shopping mall main page ^^

However, as you can see, there are some people who don’t see anything on the main page.

**App execution screen**

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-1984@3x.png)

This is because there is no store information and product registration after applying for Swing Shop!

As you can see, the main page of the shopping mall is produced as a screen with nothing.

Therefore, please check the method below and fill in the main screen.

***

**1. Main image**

1\)Swingshop store management → 2)Go to the basic information setting page and you will find the **‘Store detail image’** menu.

**The image registered here is immediately exposed as the shopping mall main image.**

If two or more images are registered, they are automatically displayed by sliding.

For the main image, we recommend **1000px wide and 545px vertical.**

**​**

**\*If you put only one image in the store detail image, only one image will be displayed without a slide.**

**\* There is no limit to the number of images, so please attach all images to be displayed as slides.**

\*Category is a large category required when registering a product.
