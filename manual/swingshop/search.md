**How to use product search**

We will inform you how to apply the ‘Product Search’ among the pages provided by Swing Shop to the app.

**Product search** is a page where you can **search for products registered** in Swing Shop.

In addition to product search, all registered products are displayed in a list, and products can be searched using the list & filter function.&#x20;

Product search is a page where products registered in Swing Shop are displayed.&#x20;

So, if there is no registered product, you won’t see any products even if you apply the product search page to the app, right?

After completing product registration at Swing Shop, please apply the product search page to the app.&#x20;
