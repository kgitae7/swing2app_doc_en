# Push App Manual(production and operation)

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kdhdnfj.png)

**Push app production, store launch method, Q\&A**

**What is a Push app?**

Push app <mark style="color:purple;">is a web app creation platform created by linking a mobile web URL such as a homepage.</mark>

Since the website is linked to the app as it is, you can create the same app as the web.

Unlike web view apps, push apps can <mark style="color:purple;">send push notifications to users who have installed the app!</mark>



![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Artboard-%E2%80%93-5.png)

If you are thinking of creating a push app, be sure to check the push app creation manual.

You can check everything from push app creation to store launch method, push delivery method, and precautions.

***

Swing2App is an app builder created by the user, and the user must create an app with the app creation tool provided by Swing2App.

When you sign up for membership after accessing the homepage, the app creation page opens immediately, and you can create apps for free!

> <mark style="color:red;">**Push app creation instructions**</mark>

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-80.png)

Occasionally, while creating a web view app or a push app, if you enter the website address and press the save button, you can see the message ‘Connection refused’ on the web preview screen.

**The message will be displayed if the connected website has a security setting that blocks external connections, that is, prohibits external sharing and embedding.**

Therefore, if you connect a link to a website with security settings in this way, you will see a connection rejection message on the web preview screen.

Even if such a message appears, **it does not mean that the app cannot be produced.**&#x20;

**You can check it more accurately if you check it with the app as it is simply not displayed on the web for security reasons.**

Therefore, please download and check the app after saving and \[App Creation Request].

If you look at it as an app, you can see that the site works normally in conjunction with the app.

If the connection is rejected in the app, please contact us through the inquiry board.

<mark style="color:red;">\*However, the URL for internal use and the site address used by the company’s internal server cannot be connected, and cannot be created with a web app.</mark>

***

### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.3 Purchase of vouchers and tickets**</mark>

There are two types of products that can be purchased in the push app.

You can purchase the product you want from among the two.



**1. Swing2App Basic Pass (Purchase a 1-month pass monthly or purchase a pass for each desired period)**

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Artboard-%E2%80%93-1.png)

**-Information of purchase products**–

Manager → Online Stores → Go to the Vouchers & Tickets page. [https://support.swing2app.com/view/shop\_list](https://swing2app.com/view/shop\_list)

<mark style="color:purple;">**▶ Swing Basic Ticket (1 month) $33 + Play Store upload ticket $5 + App Store upload ticket $20**</mark>

\-Swing basic type (1 month) product has a 30-day period of use, and if you continue to operate the store app, you must purchase it every 1 month.

\-The upload ticket is an optional product (the cost of uploading the user’s app to the store instead of the swing2app), so you only need to pay once at the time of initial registration.

<mark style="color:orange;">**\[Recommended pass]**</mark>

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Artboard-%E2%80%93-6.png)

If you purchase a 6 or 12 months long-term pass, you can use it at a lower price than purchasing a monthly pass.

<mark style="color:purple;">-Swing basic pass (12 months) $290, 26% discount from monthly purchase</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">-Basic Swing Pass (6 months) $160, 19% discount from monthly purchase</mark>

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line"> **Push-only Lifetime Paid App (Android + iPhone) $550 + Play Store upload ticket $5 + App Store upload ticket $20**

If you want to continue using the push app without a period of use, please purchase the ‘Push-only Lifetime Paid App’ product on the swing plugin purchase page.

**Once purchased, no repurchase! No period limit! Unlimited!**

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line"> **Recommended tip**

If you plan to run the app for a long period of time, and if you run the app without a period of use, we recommend purchasing the’Push-only unlimited paid app’ product.

You can purchase products for each platform according to the launch of the Play Store and App Store, so you can use them reasonably.

You can purchase each upload ticket in the same way. Play Store upload ticket $5 + App Store upload ticket $20

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/%EC%BA%A1%EC%B2%9833.png)

Before purchasing a voucher or ticket, be sure to check the product details!

If you click the <mark style="color:blue;">**\[Purchase]**</mark>** ** button, you can check the service and usage information provided in the voucher in detail.

Therefore, be sure to check the product before purchasing.

If you are not sure about the contents, please leave an inquiry on the inquiry board. We will help you in detail. ^^



**2) Please check the upload ticket issue and product details.**

\-The upload ticket is an optional product (the cost of uploading the user’s app to the store instead of the swing2app), so you only need to pay once at the time of initial registration.

\*However, if there is an app update, you need to repurchase the upload ticket because you need to update the app on the store.

\-It is up to the user to decide which store to launch, so if you only launch the App Store, you only need to purchase the App Store upload ticket.

\-If the user can directly upload the Play Store, they only need to purchase a ticket and upload it directly. (You do not need to purchase an upload ticket.)

\-Since the App Store is only available as an upload agent, if you plan to release it, be sure to purchase and apply for an App Store upload ticket.



**​3) Please register for Apple or Google developer account. (Before store registration)**

\*0In addition to the cost to pay for Swing2App, the Apple developer account registration fee (129,000 won per year) and Google developer registration fee (25 dollars, lifetime use) must be made and paid by the user.

\-Google must have a Google developer account in the user account to register

\-Apple is optional for developer account: Select between user Apple developer account registration or Swing2App account proxy registration

You must check the policies for each store.

**\*Store registration:** [**https://support.swing2app.com/view/swing\_notice\_detail?notice\_id=292\&notice\_type=normalNotice**](https://swing2app.com/view/swing\_notice\_detail?notice\_id=292\&notice\_type=normalNotice)

***

### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.5 Store launch complete (release after review)**</mark>

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/d3.png)

When the application is completed, the Swing2App playstore uploader / Appstore uploader starts the upload process to upload your app to the store.

<mark style="color:purple;">\*Play Store Review Period: 7 days</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">\*App store review period: 1 week to 2 weeks</mark>

Since the review time is long for each store, you have to wait for the review period after applying for upload.

**-When the upload process starts, we will send you an e-mail with information on policies and important notices for each store.**

**-After the normal release, an e-mail and text message (if a user number is registered) will be sent.**

**-If the screening is rejected, we will inform you of the reasons for refusal and actions to be taken, and re-examination will be done without any additional upload ticket fees.**

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Group-201-1-e1596628274458.png)

When the store launch is complete, you can check the released apps on the Play Store and App Store.

App Store is exposed when searching for the app name immediately after the app is released.

In the Play Store, even when the app is released, the name search does not work right away.

\*Google checks how actively the app is running and converts it into exposure to prevent indiscriminate release even after app release.

Therefore, you need to install a lot of apps and manage reviews, ratings, etc. As time passes, the app name search will be exposed.

Make sure to check the contents of the store policy so that there will be no problems when using the app release.

**By all means! Please check.☞** [**\[Check the store terms and conditions\]**](https://support.swing2app.com/market-policy/)

***

### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.6 Sending push from push app**</mark>

Push apps can send push messages to users who have installed the app!

Therefore, if the app is created, check the push sending function and familiarize yourself with how to send a push.

**\*Push can be sent from the Manager page → Push & Member → Send push page.**

[https://support.swing2app.com/view/push](https://support.swing2app.com/view/push)

**Precautions and push app production Q\&A**

**Q.The push app is said to be difficult to release on the App Store and Play Store. Is it correct?**

<mark style="color:purple;">**–Play Store–**</mark>

Web view and push version apps (web apps that link the website) must submit supporting documents (prior notice documents) in accordance with the Google Web View policy.

In order to prove that the site connected to the app is owned by you or the company (company), you must submit a prior notice document such as a business registration card or website domain registration confirmation.

When submitting the documents, you can launch the web view app on the Play Store without any problems.

<mark style="color:purple;">**–App Store–**</mark>

In fact, because Apple does not approve webview apps by policy, it is often rejected in the review and may not be released.

However, there are some apps that are released, so the webview app must be reviewed before you can know whether it is released.

We will appeal to you as much as possible to help launch the App Store, but please understand that we cannot determine whether the user will release the app or not!

\* PC version web other than mobile web will be rejected. The website must be connected to the mobile web.

\*Web apps that have only content for promotion or marketing on the web, have no content, or have restricted users’ participation will be rejected.

\* Please note that even if the store launch is rejected, the fee for use and upload tickets are not refundable for apps that have been registered in the App Store.



**Q. Can I create a push app by connecting to any site?**

<mark style="color:purple;">When creating a push app, you must be careful, do not use other companies or famous brands’ sites as if you were creating them!</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">You can only use the website operated by our company and the website you created (using a hosting company).</mark>

There are many users who want to link their own Naver blog or Daum Cafe through web view or push.

If these sites are linked to the app, errors or not working properly.

\* These apps cannot be released on the Play Store or App Store. (Rejected due to copyright or brand imitation)

<mark style="color:red;">And among web links, there are sites that do not work with the app, that is, embezzlement is prohibited.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">\*Portal sites such as Naver and Daum, sites provided by the portal (modoo, Storefarm Web, etc.), YouTube, and SNS sites (Instagram, KakaoTalk, Facebook) are representative sites that prohibit embedding!</mark>

Therefore, you need to apply a website (homepage) that can prove that it is the site you created with domain registration information, or a website (homepage) that can be verified with a business registration card if it is made by the company.



**Q. It is difficult to make it yourself, but if you pay the development fee, can you do the above process in Swing2App?**

Yes, if you request the production, we will make it all for you.

From designing icons and standby screen images to creating apps and uploading to the store, we will do everything.

Since app production costs and labor costs for the production agency are incurred separately, we will assist you with consultation if you request.

However, you need to create a Google developer account that will be posted on the Play Store and tell the account.

The Apple developer account is optional for the App Store, but if you use your own account, you must create your own account and tell us.

Accounts are not created in Swing2App.



**Q. Can I remove the toolbar that appears on the push app or change the toolbar design?**

Toolbar can be removed and design cannot be changed.

If you want to change the design, you have to customize it, and you have to request the development of the design you want.

<mark style="color:purple;">**\[How to remove toolbar]**</mark>

\*If you look at the Maker(V2) → Design Theme stage, there is a check box for’Show Toolbar’.

Check ‘Remove Toolbar’ and save it. Please press the app production request.

If you update the app to a new version after making the app, you can use the version with the toolbar removed.



**Q. Can I switch from push app to web view version or update from web view app to push app?**

Yes it is possible. \* Change the prototype to ‘Web View’ in the Maker(V2) → design theme stage, then save and request to create the app again.

When you receive an update to a new version, you can check the prototype changed.

If the app is released on the Play Store or App Store, you can update it to the newly created version as well.

<mark style="color:purple;">However, among web view app users, users who use the web view unlimited plug-in cannot be changed to push app.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;"></mark>

**Q. How do I change the web link address after creating a push app?**

Changing the web link address applied to the app is the same.

**Maker(V2) → Page Menu Step**

**1) Enter the URL address in the web link field → 2) Apply button → 3) Select the save button**

\*Editing the web link address is automatically reflected in the app by pressing the save button.

\*If you run the app again after closing, it will be applied to the changed website.



**Q. Will it change from a push app to a generic prototype?**

After making a push-only prototype → It cannot be changed to a normal prototype (slide, top, footer, drop-down list, drop-down box).

<mark style="color:purple;">\*If you need to change from a push-based to another prototype, you need to create and create an app.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;"></mark>

**Q. Can I apply for free commercial use of push apps?**

The application for the free commercial version can only be applied for apps created with a general prototype, and web view and push version apps are not available.



**Q. In the push app, do the changes or updates on the website are immediately reflected in the app?**

Since yes, web apps are applications that are driven by a website, the screen displayed on the website is reflected in the app as well.

Updates on the web are automatically reflected in the app even if you don’t do anything in the app.



**Q. Can functions that operate normally on the mobile web not be available in the app?**

If there is no problem on the web, the problem does not occur in the app. However, technical errors may occur at any time.

Therefore, if you have any problems while testing before launching the app, please leave it as an inquiry board.

We are helping you by checking the symptoms.
