**Swing2App Step by Step App Production Manual**

After registering on the homepage, Swing2App will open a page where you can create an app. User can create their app using the **Maker(V2)** tools.

**Please check the step by step manual on how to create an app on the Maker(V2) page.**&#x20;



\
<mark style="color:red;">**★ Before the app is created, please check the app production TIP!**</mark>

If you look next to the **Manager** and **Maker(V2)**, you’ll see **Help.**\
Clicking on the **Help** will take you to the corresponding help manual site describing how to use or create an app.

Therefore, when you want to check the manual while creating an app, be sure to check the **Help,** to view the manual.



&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.1 APP BASICS**</mark>

**App Basics** is a step to input basic information required for the app production like registering the app name, logo image, splash screen image, etc.

When you enter the app production page, the following page will open.
