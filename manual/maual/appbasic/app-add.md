Basic Information – How to create an app\
Swing2App can create and manage multiple apps in 1 account.

* **Free customers can create up to 3 apps in one account.**
* **Paid customers can create up to 10 apps in one account. (1 paid app + 9 free apps)**

Therefore if you are creating an app and you want more, you can create it to match the number of available apps.\
**We will show you how to create additional new apps in your account.**
