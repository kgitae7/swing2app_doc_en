**How to use the Web Link menu at the page menu?**

Web Link is a menu that opens when you copy and paste the URL address (link) of a website.\
You can put a web link directly on the home screen so that the website pops up when you run the app.\
You can link to the web page you want by setting the web link for each menu.\
\
Example:\
After entering the web URL address in the \[Home Page] menu, you can also link the web URL address such as a blog, Instagram, Facebook to the website you entered when selecting the menu.

\
How to use web links, as well as their options.\
\[Open in new window], \[Open as external app] function will also be announced.\
**We’ll show you how to use the \[web link] menu in the page menu step.**&#x20;

Why do I need to see a new window or open it with an external app?

Some sites are sometimes banned from loading when applying web links.\
\*Portal sites such as Naver, YouTube, SNS sites (Instagram, KakaoTalk, Facebook), etc. are some of the sites that have been banned from loading.\
When you link a site that is banned from loading in the app, the site will not open in the app.

☞ The way to solve the problem is \[open in new window], \[open as external app] function.\
It’s not about opening links inside the app, it’s about creating a new window in the app so that the site can be opened without problems.\
Therefore, if the linked site does not open in the app, please make sure you choose one of the two options.

If you apply a link to the home screen, you can only apply it in a style that opens within the app.\
In the general menu except for the home screen, you can open in a new window or open in an external app.

**Launch the app to see how the new window is different from the external app view.**

Select the \[Open YouTube in a new window] menu and you’ll see a new web page in the app.\
Do you see an internet search bar at the top??

<mark style="color:red;">★ You will be redirected to the YouTube weblink you have applied as a new web page appears within the app.</mark> \


\
<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ Open as External App**</mark>

Select the \[Open with YouTube external app] menu.\
Then, **unlike the new window, you can see the YouTube app running.**\
<mark style="color:red;">**★ Weblink address you have applied – the application is running directly within the App.**</mark>  \
<mark style="color:red;">**★ Opening to an external app will open after selecting a different application path if the app is not installed on the phone.**</mark>\


Opening in a new window, opening in an external app, etc., is the same as being able to open a web page, but there is a difference in the style shown in the app.

Because it is optional, you can select and apply the menu the way you want.
