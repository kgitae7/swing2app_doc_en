**How to create a web template page**

The template page is a web page creation tool provided by the user page – a design template creation tool for each industry.

Users can create web pages by simply entering text, images, and so on, as outlined on the designed page.

By providing templates for each style and industry for web pages that are difficult to design directly, users can easily create pages.
