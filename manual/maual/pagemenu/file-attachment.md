<mark style="color:red;">**\[Information]**</mark>

1\) Files can be attached to document files such as images (png, jpg, gif), words, ppt, and pdf.

2\) The capacity that can be uploaded at one time is 10MB.

3\) We do not recommend files that are too large because files are also counted as app size.

For example, if a video file is too large, it is recommended to use it as a web link (Youtube link) because it takes up the app’s capacity!!

4\) Only one file can be uploaded to the attached file. (Multiple files cannot be registered)

If you need to upload multiple files, you need to create multiple categories and upload them to each menu.

Or, if you use the file attachment function within the post using the bulletin board-post, you can attach multiple files to the body.
