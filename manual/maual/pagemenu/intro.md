![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/swing\_intro.png)

**What is an app introduction?**\
**App introduction is one of the menus that decorate the main home screen in the home screen style provided by the swing2app page.**

App introduction and site address (URL), address, phone number, and email address can show the most basic home screen composition design.

Since we don’t know what to put on the home screen when we first created the app with Swing2App, we provide the app introduction page by default to show users the home screen guidelines.

So the home screen is, of course, in addition to the app introduction page, a variety of other menus like – image pages, web templates, HTML editor pages, images, bulletin boards, weblinks, etc.  can be freely changed.

**This is the screen with the app introduction page.**

**This is a style with an image of the app icon, with the app introduction, website link (URL), and navigation buttons at the bottom.**

App introduction is the home main screen that provides a basic setting for those who create the app as a swing2app for the first time.

Therefore, you do not have to use the home screen as an ‘app introduction’.

You can make your home screen with various other menus.
