This is the app execution screen with the setup feature applied.

The setting includes both membership and login.

Therefore, you don’t need to use the sign-up or login function and just apply the settings to the app.

In addition to these features <mark style="color:purple;">\*Notify-Push settings, check notification lists, share apps, check app versions, log in administrator, and close apps.</mark>

Therefore, we recommend that you apply the setting function to the app when producing the app!

Administrator login is a function that allows you to log in from the app as an administrator and operate it.

You can find out how to use the function in detail by checking the link in the manual below.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Important guidance**</mark>

1\)The member subscription, login, and settings provided on the swing page are not applicable to the home screen.

It can only be applied to the app menu (category), so please use only the menu.

2\) We recommend that you use one function of ‘Login’ rather than sign-in and sign-in together.

Or use the ‘Settings’ menu that comes with the member registration and login menu.

3\)The membership form can be modified at [**https://www.swing2app.com/view/app\_policy**](https://www.swing2app.com/view/app\_policy) on the \[Member Subscription Form Settings] page. When the ID form is modified, it is reflected in the login screen.

4\)The setting page is provided with a fixed content UX, so items cannot be modified like membership.

You can only use the page provided.

5\) All functions (page) on the swing page are only available in a fixed design, so style modification is not possible.

Depending on the color of the prototype, the background color can be modified, but the design cannot be changed.
