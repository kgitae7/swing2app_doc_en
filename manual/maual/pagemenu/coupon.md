**What is the View Coupon Menu?**

**View Coupon is a coupon inquiry page for users to check the coupon issued by the app, and to check the used coupon.**

When an administrator issues a coupon to a user, the user needs a page to see a list of the coupons they have received.

The View Coupons menu allows the user to see the list of coupons received and the list of redeemed coupons.

Therefore, if you operate a coupon issuance app, you must apply the menu in app creation.

This feature is available in Maker(V2)→ Page Menu → Swing2App Page.

We will show you how to use the view coupon menu applied to the app.
