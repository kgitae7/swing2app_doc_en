**What is the HTML Editor page?**

One of the functions provided by the user page of the swing2app operation page is a menu that allows users to create their own web pages.

You can freely place your posts and images as if you were typing them into a blog or café.

You can apply web links, videos, text effects, and more.

The biggest feature is that you can freely create the style you want.
