**App Home Screen Introduction Page**

We will show you how to apply the app introduction page on the app home screen.

<mark style="color:red;">★The home screen can be selected and applied to a variety of menus.</mark>

The app introduction is the initial home screen menu setting when creating a swing2app.

Since the menu is provided as a sample, users are encouraged to make the home screen with different menus according to the app style.

<mark style="color:red;">**★ App introduction screen is applied as the initial default setting value when you first create an app with swing2app, so you don’t have to apply it separately.**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;"></mark>&#x20;

However, if you change the home screen back to the app introduction screen using a different menu, you can apply it using the above method.

Changes can be checked through the virtual machine.

The first time you create an app, you need to make an app to reflect it. When you edit the app again, it is automatically reflected in the app when you save it.
