<mark style="color:blue;">**Image size guide**</mark>​

Among the questions that many people ask, you ask about the image size.

Since the image is shown according to the size of the mobile phone, there is no exact size and the same size for all phones.

If you want to work tightly on the screen, please work with the **Android phone standard size of 1080px and 1920px.**

The image shown in the manual was also registered as the image worked at the above size.

​

The vertical part of the image is adjusted to fit the width of the screen.

Therefore, when viewed from a phone, the horizontal screen fits perfectly. **The vertical length may be longer on the screen or the screen may remain depending on the phone model.**

​

Please insert the image and adjust the size while checking the screen applied to the phone.

However, the image size mentioned is for Android phones and iPhones, and tablets are an exception.
