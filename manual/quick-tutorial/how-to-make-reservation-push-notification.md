# How To Make Reservation Push Notification

**Push** is a tool that you can use to deliver announcements, events, and advertisements to members who use the app. You can also provide a link to the page containing the content you want to convey. And with **Reservation Settings,** you can set schedule (date & time) to send push. If you want to send push right away, do not check the reservation settings, go directly to push send.
