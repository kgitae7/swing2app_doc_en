## **2.**Prototype

**\[STEP2 Prototype]** is the step of determining the overall design and style of the app's UI design and color.

![](broken-reference)

**1. Select a prototype: Select the prototype that determines the design of your app's UI.**

\*Swing2App offers a total of 7 prototype designs.

**​**

**2. Basic styles and options**

Select Color Set: Sets the app and color of the UI design.

It offers a color combination consisting of 3 sets which are the main background colors, text colors, and theme colors.

Once you have selected the desired combination, you can see the UI changing colors in real-time through the virtual machine.



**3. Advanced styles and options**

This feature allows you to set additional color options and design styles that you can add to the prototype UI.

This is not a required setting, users can modify if they want to.

​

**4. Custom settings**

**​**

> <mark style="color:red;">What if none of the combined colors present in the preset are not as per your interest? In that case,  please use the detailed settings.</mark>

![](broken-reference)

If the desired color is not present, the user can select the color directly in \[Detailed Settings].

In addition to the fixed color combinations, the detailed color setting is an option that allows the user to select and apply their own colors.

**\*If you have applied both the prototype and the skin color during the design phase, save it and go to the next step.**

****

## **STEP3 Page**

**\[STEP3 PAGE] is a step to create categories and menus for the app.**

![](broken-reference)

The Home option is to set the main home screen of the app.&#x20;

On the left area, you can set menus of the app.

We'll show you how to apply the home screen and menus of the app.

![](broken-reference)

****

### **1.** How to apply the home screen

The Home screen is the main screen that is visible when you launch the app, and you can configure how the main screen will be displayed by the user themselves.

Menus provided by the Swing-to-App – You can apply menus such as weblinks, swing pages, user pages, bulletin boards, images, and more.

In this guide, we'll apply industry-specific templates.

We'll show you how to apply the home screen and how to apply the menu.

![](broken-reference)

Select \<home> from the category on the left

1\) TEnter the name that will be shown at the top of the menu name input screen.After typing, click the cursor once or press the Enter button to reflect it directly to the virtual machine

2\) Page Design: Select an industry-specific template and then select the New button.

\*Since you don't have any pages created, you must first go to the Page Template Creator to create a template page.

****

<mark style="color:green;">**\[Template Page Authoring Tool]**</mark>

![](broken-reference)

To learn how to create a template page, please check out the production manual below!

**After creating the template, please return to the app creation screen.**

3\)When you select the Refresh button, the template you created will pop up on the screen.

4\)Hover the mouse cursor over the template to **\<preview, apply, manage>** menu will pop up

If you want to check before applying the app, select 'Preview', 'Apply' to apply the app, and 'Manage' for modifications.

Select the Apply menu.

5\)Select the \[Save] button to check the template applied to the home screen on the virtual machine screen.



### **2.**Menu Management

**​**

<mark style="color:green;">**1)Add and delete menus**</mark>

![](broken-reference)

The menus listed in the category on the left can all be modified to include the menus

that you initially set in the Swing To app.

Therefore, you can delete and add menus that you don't need, and organize them into the menus you want.

When you hover your mouse over the menu, the trash can-shaped icon, the +shaped icon, pops up.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Delete menu: Select the trash can icon**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Add menu: + icon selection**</mark>

You can easily delete and add menus.

Select the menu with your mouse, grab it, and drag it to where you want to move.

The position you are dragging completes the menu movement. – Can be configured as a sub or top menu.



## **STEP4** Creating an App

****

Once you've finished building your app, you can actually build it by selecting the Build App button.

<mark style="color:red;">\*STEP step must be 100% complete before production is possible.</mark>

​

Even after the app is built, the app you create is free to modify at any time.

So if you want to check with the app first, you can create it roughly, and then after verification, you can modify and update it again in the App Creation Wizard.

![](broken-reference)

1\)Select the Save button

2\)Select the Create App button.

3\)Select \[Create] in the Update Options window.

<mark style="color:red;">\*Update type, display options can be made as checked.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">Since this is your first time building an app (there is nothing to update), no matter how you apply it, it won't affect your production.</mark>

If you subsequently modify the app and proceed with the update, please select the form you want.



## **STEP5** Complete App Creation&#x20;

****

![](broken-reference)

If you click Create App on the App Creation page, you will be immediately taken to the App History page on the App Operations page.

If you check the status of each platform, is it still marked as 'Pending Production Order'?

You can check the progress of your app's creation on that screen.

Please be patient because it will be made within 5 minutes after pressing the app creation request \~!

****

![](broken-reference)

In less than 1 minute while I was waiting for the production, a \[Swing Preview] pop-up window popped up.

It's a feature that allows you to preview the app through a swing preview before it is created.

\*View on the web: Select the \[Watch directly on the web] button to preview apps created on virtual machines on the web.

\*Preview to your phone: After downloading the official Swing-to-App app – App Preview menu – log in with your swing account or scan the QR code shown in the pop-up window and you can preview the app on your phone! (It's a preview, not a down)

****

![](broken-reference)

After a while, the platform-specific status is "App Creation Complete!" I can see that it has been changed.

With App Preview, you can download the app from your Android phone.

Or, when the production is complete, the **APK file** (the file that you can download the app from) will be sent to you via Swing2App subscription email.

You can also open the mailbox on your phone to download and install the **APK file** directly.

**​**

\*APK The file will not be opened on your PC, so be sure to check it on your phone.

\*APK file installation can only be installed on Android phones. (iPhones are not supported.)
