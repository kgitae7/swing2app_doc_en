**1. Select a prototype: Select the prototype that determines the design of your app's UI.**

**2. Default style and options: Select color set: Set the skin color of the UI design**

**3. Advanced styles and options**

This feature allows you to set additional color options and design styles that you can add to the prototype UI.

This is not required, just for those who want to set the options.

4\. When you have completed entering the design steps, click the **\[Save]** button to save your work.

The general prototype style is available in 5 different designs.\*Except for webviews/pushes only

Once you have selected each prototype, you can use the virtual machine on the right (preview screen) to see the prototype UI style applied to your app.

**Select Color Set: Sets the skin color of the UI design.**

Skin Color offers a color combination consisting of 3 sets of main background colors, letter colors, and theme colors.

Once you have selected the desired combination, you can see the UI changing colors in real time through the virtual machine.

If the desired color is not present, the user can select the color directly in \[Detailed Settings].

In addition to the fixed color combinations, the detailed color setting is an option that allows the user to select and apply their own colors.

The main design style can also be changed from basic to transparent.

If you set the main design style to transparent, the bar area shown at the top disappears. In other words, it will change to a transparent area.

When selecting the transparent option, you can utilize the top bar area 100%.

However, when you set the area to transparent, if you have a background laid out behind it, you can configure the app in a quality way!

It is recommended to apply the home screen to template pages, image pages, etc.
