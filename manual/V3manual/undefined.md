# App Terms of Use, Privacy Policy

**Terms of Use? What is the Privacy Policy?**

These are the terms and conditions that set out what information we collect from users of the app (personal information) and what mandatory usage policies are for the app.

This is a mandatory policy and must be entered in the mobile app.

﻿

The App Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are policies that you must enter into your app as required, not optional.

What information is collected from the membership, how to use and destroy the information, the period of use of personal information, the information in charge of personal information protection (person in charge), etc., etc., must be provided to the user in accordance with the Information and Communications Network Act.

Because a swing-to-app is created by the user as a developer and the app is created by the user, these policies must also be put into the app by the user.&#x20;

Customized users should also modify and use the Terms of Use directly to suit the App Service.

Swing2App provides the ability to <mark style="color:red;">write the terms of use and privacy policy on the app subscription policy page so that users can edit and write the contents themselves.</mark>

So if you check how you use the menu, you can easily incorporate the policy into your app.

**Where and how do the App Terms of Use and Privacy Policy look like?**

![](broken-reference)

**1)After launching the app, on the registration page – select \[Check the Terms of Use] and you can check the contents.**

The menu is created by default when the app is created, so the user doesn't have to put it in separately.

You can change the terms of use and the contents of the Privacy Policy.



2\)When you release your app to the Play Store or the App Store, you will also include the privacy policy URL in the release information field.

Because it is a mandatory registration, those who release apps to the Store must also complete and submit the applicable terms.

<mark style="color:blue;">**App Operation Page → Service Management → PolicyManagement→ \[App Subscription Policy]**</mark> Go to the menu.

### ****![](broken-reference) **2.** Fill out the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy



On the App Subscription Policy page, in addition to the terms of use, **you can edit your app's privacy and sign-up notice.**

\*App Registration Policy: For detailed usage methods such as how to create a private app and how to modify the registration statement, please refer to the manual.

**☞ **<mark style="color:blue;">**Check the App Subscription Policy How-to Manual**</mark>

![](broken-reference)

You can check the 'Terms of Use' and 'Privacy Policy' sections in the Terms of Service.

When you create an app with Swing, you must fill out the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy items together.



![](broken-reference)

**As you can see in the image, Swing has a default set of ments for those who are not sure what to put the policy into.**

This makes it easier to write.

Even if you don't modify the menu, this will still be reflected in the App Terms of Use.

However, since it is a sample menu, there are definitely things that need to be corrected, such as the name of the trade name, the name of the person in charge of personal information, etc. \~

Please check the contents and modify it for your app service.

For each question, you can select the button on the right to write the content.

Since the content of this setting varies from service to service to service, the user must check and modify it.

In particular, the last \[Name of the person in charge of personal information or the person in charge, contact information] is written as an example, so please modify it as the actual administrator and enter it\~!

After modifying the contents on that page, click the \[Set Policy] button to save.

<mark style="color:red;">**★ If you're new to apps, be sure to tap Set Policy to reflect the policies in your app.**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">****</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
There are 7 items in the privacy policy that the user must write and insert directly to the app's services.

This item was updated in November 2017.

★ The mobile application must also provide a privacy policy\~!!

This is a policy officially put forward by the Korea Internet & Security Agency and the Broadcasting and Communications Commission.

If you violate it, you may be fined under the Information and Communications Network Act, so be sure to fill it out!!

The terms of service you have created can be found by URL.

Select \[View Terms of Service URL Details] at the bottom.

&#x20;

As shown in the image above, a new webpage window will pop up with the terms of use.

Just copy the URL address from the Internet address bar and submit it where you need it.



{% hint style="info" %}
**Why do I need a URL?**

The URL is required for Google Play Store and App Store app registration.

When you apply to upload to the Google Play Store and App Store – you must provide the URL of your privacy policy in the Store Registration field.

At this time, users who have created the app with Swing-to-App can copy and paste the URL of the applicable Terms of Service!!

Therefore, the Terms of Service do not use the default settings in Swing Two, but make sure that it fits the service!! Please modify it and use it.

(Please note that if you use the trade name or app name as it is without modifying it, you may run into problems.)

To learn how to apply the link to the Privacy Policy on the Play Store, please refer to the manual below.

****

1\) Push, WebView app is a web app created by linking the user's website (homepage) to the app.

Therefore, you can submit the privacy policy to the link to the privacy policy provided on the user's homepage.

The terms and conditions provided by the Swing to App are applicable only to the user's app created with a regular prototype app (slide, footer, top, etc.).

2\) Please modify the Terms of Use and use them.

Swing-to-app is not responsible for problems caused by not entering content or problems caused by entering content that is different from the service.

Therefore, please check it carefully and make it.

3\) Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are provided together.

Since the Terms and Conditions provide all the information about personal information, please modify and apply the above Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy will be completed.

4\) The terms and conditions provided by the Swing-to-App are the services provided to users who create apps with Swing-to-App\~!

However, sometimes people who don't build an app with a swing and only take the URL of the terms and conditions and use it as a link to the privacy policy are receiving more and more reports.

**We haven't created an app with our service, but we don't want to use our own program! It is strictly an unauthorized theft of the program.**

**Therefore, those who continuously filter and use our unique Usage Policy URL will report it to Google for action.**

If you receive it on Google, the app may be deleted, so please be sure to check and be careful\~!!
