STEP1 The basic information step has been entered.

Except for the app ID, the app name, icons, and standby screen images can be modified even after the app is created.

* **When you register an icon image or an image that does not fit the size during the upload of a standby screen image, you can modify the size through the image editing tool.**

### ![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png) What are image editing tools?

**The image editing tool is a feature that allows you to easily modify the size with the editing tools provided by the Swing-to-App when you need to modify the image size when creating the app.**

If the image size you want to upload when creating the app is different from the recommended image size listed in the creation method, you can easily modify the size.

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%8E%B8%EC%A7%91%EC%B0%BD1.png)

The app icon image is sized in size from **1024 x 1024 px** horizontally to portrait .

If the attached image does not match the size, a window will pop up stating that the size does not match as shown in the image above.

Selecting 'OK' will take you to the Image Editing Tools window.

As you can see in the image, the image editing tool window **specifies the amount of area (blue line) of the size of the image that needs to be uploaded.**

You can select the blue line with the mouse to pull it or shorten it. You can modify the image by adjusting it to fit the area.

If the image is large, you can drag the area with the mouse to apply it so that the image you want is placed inside the area.

When the modification is complete, please select the \[Upload (Modify Completed)] button.

The image size correction is complete.

After checking the image uploaded in the file attachment window, select the \[Apply] button.

Select the \[Save] button on the authoring screen to complete the registration.

<mark style="color:red;">**\[Editing Tool Precautions]**</mark>

1\)When registering an image with a recommended size, it is recommended to register the image after both design and size work has been completed through the picture editing program.

Since the icons, standby screens are large images with a resolution that is immediately visible when installing a mobile phone app, it is much better in terms of quality to register the finished image than to artificially modify the size.

2\)The image editing tool **only provides the ability to resize the image to modify its size.**

It does not offer picture editing functions such as Photoshop, Illustration, and Paint. Therefore, please use a finished image with a design.

3\)f you upload an image that is smaller than the image size that needs to be uploaded, the image resolution may be bad because the size must be increased than the original.

(If the image uploaded is less in size than the image size **1024×1024** above)

Therefore, we recommend that you use images that are larger than the specified size.
