# How to create an additional app

### How to create an additional app

Swing2App lets you create and manage multiple apps in one account!

**+Free customers can create up to 3 apps in one account**

**+Paid customers can create up to 10 apps in one account.**

You can only create additional apps, and if it's not a paid app, it's all made for free.

So if you're building an app and you want to build another one, you can create more apps to suit the number of them.\~!!

We'll show you how to create additional new apps in your account.

## \*\*\*\* **1.** PC Version – Create additional apps

**First, let's access the PC version of the Swing2App homepage and add the app\~**

**After logging in to the Swing-to-App homepage, go to \[App Creation].**

There is a button that looks like a **\[+]** at the top of the App Maker screen.

This button is the Add App Authoring button, and when you select Add App Authoring, **the App Authoring Wizard pop-up window appears.**

When you select a new app style (type), the same app creation maker screen will pop up and you can proceed with the app creation step by step.

## \*\*\*\* **2.** Mobile version – Create additional apps

**In addition to the PC version of the site, the Swing-to-App can also be used on mobile to create an app! Did you know?**

**We'll also show you how to select Create \[Add App] on your mobile site.**

I accessed the Swing-to-App site on my mobile. The same goes for the app-authoring page.

On mobile, you **can create additional apps by pressing the + button next to the app name.**

When you select the appropriate button, **the \[App Creation Wizard]** window will pop up just like the PC version , and you can create a new app.

The subsequent production method is the same.

## \*\*\*\* **3.** See the list of apps you've created

**Where can I find a list of apps created by Swing-to-App as well as newly added apps?**

**We're providing a list of apps in the upper-left corner of the Swing2App dashboard.**

Select the app name or the arrow button with the mouse to open a list of apps.

You can see which apps you have in your account.

When you create an app, simply select the app from the list and go to the app creation page.

### **▶**Manage your apps

<mark style="color:blue;">**Go to App Operations-My Menu-Retained App Management**</mark> to see the app information that the user has.

You can see the information related to the app along with the app you have.

On the Manage Apps page, you can uninstall (delete) apps, change the sort order of apps, use expiration dates, and view simple information such as the number of members.
