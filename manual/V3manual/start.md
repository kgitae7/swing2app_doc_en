# Start with the MakerV3 App Creatio Screen

MakerV3 App Creation Screen - Choose app type that you wish to create

Before you build an app, you first choose what style and type of app you want to build, and then you build the app.

It's called the App Creation Wizard, and there are 3 ways to create it.

### ****![](broken-reference)How to make it

\-Create an app with all the designs on it using a template (normal prototype)

\-Web view linked to the website, push app creation

\-Writing an app that organizes both menus and pages directly (normal prototype)



The App Creation Wizard is the screen that pops up when you create a new app or add a new app.

It does not float during production.

After selecting one of the methods and entering the basic information that goes into the app, the full-fledged App Creation Maker screen opens.

Check the manual to see the manufacturing method features for each type.



## Method 1. Faster app creation

![](broken-reference)

It's about building an app using a template. Build it as a regular prototype.&#x20;

**If you choose , the next step will be to choose the type of template you want to use.**

**In the next step, register the app name, icon image, and standby image and you're done with the basic design!**

**Start building a full-fledged app in the App Maker maker.**



If you struggle with each page-specific design and menu configuration, the advantage is that you can easily create an app by choosing a template with all the industry-specific designs.

Pages with all designs can be created by modifying only the text such as images, titles, and bodies, and features such as linking/banner linking.

Think about the style of the app you want to create, so choose and build it.

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**\*The design UI tool configured in the template itself cannot be modified.**</mark>

If you want to configure all the UI screens individually, please check the menus provided by the page in the App Creation Maker and configure and insert each menu.

<mark style="color:green;">**\*You don't have to build the app again.**</mark>

Since you can modify and update the app you created, feel free to modify and create it by working with the template and changing it to the regular menu.





## Method 2. Web Based on Website

![](broken-reference)

The second method is the web app authoring style.

A web app that creates a website by applying it directly to the app - this is the type of web view or push app that you can create.

If you're building a webview or push app, choose the second method to create it.

**After selecting a web app, you can select the basic information required for the web app - the website address, and whether to use push.**

**In the last step, register the app name, icon image, and standby image and you're done with the basic design!**

**​**

<mark style="color:green;">**\*When using the push function - It is made as a push app, and it is made into a webview app when checking it without use.**</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**Push usage is also freely modifiable in the app creation maker.**</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**\*In addition, the menus provided in the web app can also be selected from the creation maker to complete the creation of the app.**</mark>



## Method 3. Start from scratch

![](broken-reference)

The third way is to build a generic prototype app, organizing and building all the menus and pages yourself.

If you don't have the design you want, or if you want to customize the UI configuration yourself, choose the third method and create it!

​

**If you choose , the next step is to choose a prototype style, and choose the color of your app.**

**In the next step, register the app name, icon image, and standby image and you're done with the basic design!**

**Start building a full-fledged app in the App Maker maker.**&#x20;

&#x20;&#x20;

**​**

<mark style="color:green;">**\*You can modify and update any number of times in the App Creation Maker, so if you want to change what you chose initially, you can modify it by overwriting it with an existing app.**</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**\*you can still choose a template at the page level.**</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**Therefore, you can freely combine and create regular app creation styles + template styles, etc.**</mark>

**​**

In the App Creation Wizard, select the type of app you want to create and create your app.
