Selecting the New button takes you to the -> Template Authoring Tool.

You can add a template page here to create it.

I'll tell you how to use it in detail below\~!

\-The page name at the top is the page name displayed in the app, so please modify it and use it.

\- Modification of anything that goes into the area is of course possible.

\-Text: Both the text size and color can be specified, and the title area is provided to adjust the margins.

\- Both adding and deleting buttons are possible.

\- You can link to the page you want using \[Link Wizard] in each area,

\- If you don't need the entry, check 'Deactivate' in Enable or Not, and the area will be deleted from the template.

There's no other simple app creation like this, because you just have to modify it on top of a template that's already fully tooled, right?^^

**\*\*\*\* Create a different style template page**

5\) The templates in different styles are the same, when you select a page, it will appear on the screen.

If you look at the right, you can modify and apply them one by one in the areas that can be modified.

**6) Even when you attach an image, you can register the desired image by pressing the image button.**

Each template has an image size that lists the images. It's good if you fit the image according to the size.

Even if the size has not been modified, pressing the Edit Image button will open the \[Image Editing Tools] window.

Here you can register by adjusting it to the size of the image.

**7) The Link Wizard refers to the links that can be applied to each banner (button).**

If you select the \[Link Wizard] button, you can select the page (link) you want to link with as shown in the image above.

In addition to the regular website web links, the Swing-to-App app can integrate all the features used within the app.

**8) When all the work is done, be sure to press the \[Save] button.**

You need to press Save to save the page perfectly!!

Items are reflected on the page as soon as they are modified.

When all is done, press the \[Save] button and the page is finished saving as you are working.

Modifying a template is the same as going to the App Creation Maker – Industry-Specific Templates page \[Modify] and overwriting it on top of the page you created.

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/%ED%85%9C%ED%94%8C%EB%A6%BF%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%803.png)

**Select the \[Manage] button and then select the \[Modify] button →.**

Go to the Web Template Page Authoring Tool screen.

Template modifications don't have a separate page.

You can update it by entering the same as the creation page, overwriting it on top of an existing page and making modifications.
