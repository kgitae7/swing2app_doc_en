The WebView version is also an app platform that creates mobile websites by applying them exactly to the app.

Unlike the push version, you can't send a "push message" because it's an app style that doesn't use other app features and only creates by clicking a link to a website.

As you can see in the image, the mobile web and the webview app you create are the same without any difference.

When creating a webview app or push app, after entering the website address, you can see that the virtual machine (preview screen) displays the message "Please check after installing the app on your mobile phone" or "Refused to connect".

**If the security that prevents external connections within the website you connected to, that is, the prohibition of external sharing and embedding, is enabled, you will see the message.**

Therefore, when you link to a website that has this security setting, you will see a message that says Deny Connection on the web preview screen.

Even if you get these messages, it **doesn't mean you can't build an app.**

**You can check more accurately by simply checking with the app that the screen cannot be displayed on the web for security reasons.**

**Therefore, please save and \[Create App] and download it to the app to confirm.**

If you look at it as an app, you can see that the site works normally with the app.

If the app also refuses to connect, please contact the inquiry board.

\*However, the URL for internal use and the site address used by the company's internal server cannot be connected and cannot be created as a web app.

To learn how to download (install) your app, please check the manual below.

### ![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png) **** Please be careful when creating push and webview apps.

**1) There is a web link that does not work with the app, that is, there is a site that prohibits embedding.**

\*Naver, the following portal sites, and the sites provided by the portal (modoo, storefarm web, etc.), YouTube, social media sites (Instagram, KakaoTalk, Facebook), etc. are the representative sites that have been banned from embedding!

Therefore, you **need to apply a homepage that can prove that you created it with domain registration information, and a website (homepage) that can be verified by a business registration certificate if it is created by the company.**

There are many users who want to link their Naver blog or the next café with a webview or push.

These sites will error or will not function properly if you link them to the app.

**\* These apps should not be released on the Play Store or the App Store.**

Therefore, please do not apply the above links to webview apps, push apps.

It's okay to put that link in an external menu from another prototype, but make sure that the app link itself doesn't use the above site address.

**2) Do not change from a push-version or webview-version prototype to another prototype.**

After being built as a webview-based (push, webview) prototype, → cannot be changed to a generic prototype (slide,

\*If you need to change from a webview-based prototype to a different prototype, you'll need to create a new app.

**3) If your goal is to commercialize the app (launch the store), please use the paid version.**

**Push or webview apps also need to be purchased and used as a paid version of the Swing Paid App in order to launch the app on the Play Store or App Store.**

**TIP. If you launch the store with a webview or a push app, you can purchase an unlimited subscription and you will have unlimited access to the app for a fee with no limit on the duration of the service.**

**4) The web link (site URL) applied when using the push app and the webview app can be changed while using it. (No need to create an app, just press Save to automatically reflect)**

It's the same as building the first app.

In the menu step of the → page of the app creation page, you can modify the URL in the website address field → the → HOME button and save it.

Exit and relaunch the app and it will be applied to the changed website.

\*However, users of Push Unlimited Paid App Subscription will need to save and re-create the app. You will need to update to the new version to be reflected.
