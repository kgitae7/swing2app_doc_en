# App launch screen by update type

### App launch screen depending on the update type

If you have checked how to update and what is important! Depending on the type of update, let's see how the update works in the actual app.

{% hint style="info" %}
**\*The app launch screen we show you is an app that has not been released in the Store (install it on your phone as an APK file)**

**\*\*If your app has been released on the Play Store or App Store, you will need to update it and re-upload it to the updated version on that Store.**

**Apps downloaded from the Store must be updated through the Store.**

**\*Users will not receive the update if they update the app to a new version, but do not re-upload it to that version in the Store.**
{% endhint %}

### **1)** Soft Updates & Recommendations

The recommendation is that a message window will **pop up asking if you want to do the update as shown in the image above.**

**The user must select 'OK' for the update to proceed.**

Because the recommendation is for the update to progress by the user, **if you select 'Cancel', the update will not proceed.**

For soft updates, if you don't have to reinstall the app, it will be **downloaded from within the app and will be updated automatically.**

Because it's a soft update, you don't have to reinstall the app to do the same, it's **downloaded from within the app and gets auto-updated.**

When selecting the display option as 'Required', **a pop-up will pop up to guide you in the progress of the update without asking the user.**

**When you select 'OK', the in-app update will take place immediately.**

**Hard update, on the recommended selection, a message window will pop up asking if you want to do the → update, and the user will have to select 'OK' before the update will proceed.**

**If you choose to 'Cancel' because it is optional, the update will not proceed.**

And in the case of hard updates, unlike soft updates, **you'll go to your phone device and reinstall the new version of the app.**

You will install an update to an existing application, which will be overwritten and installed with a new version of the app.

**\[Reinstall Progress]**

Hard Update, if you choose Required, do not ask for user selection, press OK and the update will proceed immediately.

The same hard update will **go to your phone device and reinstall the new version of the app.**

You will install an update to an existing application, which will be overwritten and installed with a new version of the app.

**\[Instructions]**

Apps created by Swing-to-App are free to modify even after the app is built.

**Page menu steps – Contents such as menu modification and content registration are automatically reflected in the app by simply pressing \[Save], so you do not need to update them separately.**

**In addition, the various functions provided by the operation of the app can be applied and immediately reflected in the app.**

**- What needs to be updated**

**\*App Basics – Modify app name, icon, standby screen image**

**\*Design Themes - Prototypes, skin color modifications require app updates.**

So press the \[Update App] button to recreate the app in a new version.

When you are updated to a newly created version, the modifications are reflected.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Important\***</mark>Soft updates are not officially provided by Apple and Google.

**Therefore, users who have released an app to the Play Store or the App Store are advised not to use the soft update, but to proceed with the → Hard Update, and then update the newly created version of the app to the Store.**

As a soft update, you can receive reimbursement such as the removal of the app in accordance with the rules of the Play Store and the App Store when it is made.

The Swing-to-App is not responsible for this option, so be sure to check it out before proceeding.
