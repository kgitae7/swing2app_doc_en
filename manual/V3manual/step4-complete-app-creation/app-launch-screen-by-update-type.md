# App launch screen by update type

### App launch screen depending on the update type

Depending on the type of update, let's see how the update works in the actual app.

{% hint style="info" %}
**\*The app launch screen we show you is an app that has not been released in the Store.**

**\*\*If your app has been released on the Play Store or App Store, you will need to make the hard update and re-upload the newly created version on the store.**&#x20;

**Apps downloaded from the Store must be updated through the Store.**

**\*Users will not receive the update if you will only update the app to a new version, without re-upload the newly created version on the store.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

***

### **1)** Soft Updates & Recommended Updates. <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>&#x20;

In this type of update, the message window will **pop up asking users if they want to update the app.**&#x20;

**The user must select 'OK' for the update to proceed.**

Because the recommendation is for the update to progress by the user, if you **select 'Cancel', the update will not proceed.**

For soft updates, you don't have to reinstall the app, update will be **downloaded from within the app and will be updated automatically.**

### **2)** Soft Updates & Required Updates.&#x20;

Because it's a soft update, you **don't have to reinstall the app, it's downloaded from within the app and gets auto-updated.**

When selecting the display **option as 'Required',** **a pop-up will appear to inform the user that an update is taking place.** &#x20;

**When you select 'OK', the in-app update will take place immediately.**

### **3)**Hard Update & Recommended Updates. <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>&#x20;

**Hard update, on the recommended selection, a message window will pop up asking if you want to do the → update, and the user will have to select 'OK' before the update will proceed.**

If you **choose to 'Cancel'** because it is optional, the update will not proceed.

In case of a hard update, unlike software**, it moves to the mobile phone device and installs the new version of the app again.**

It will install the update of the existing application and install it again by overwriting it with the new version of the app.

**\[Reinstall Progress]**

Hard Update, if you choose Required, **the update will proceed immediately if you click OK.**

The same hard update will **go to your phone device and reinstall the new version of the app.**

It will install the update of the existing application and install it again by overwriting it with the new version of the app.

**\[Reinstall Progress]**

### <mark style="color:red;">\[Instructions]</mark>

You can freely edit the app created by Swing-to-App even after making the app.

**Page menu steps – Contents such as menu modification and content registration are automatically reflected in the app by simply pressing \[Save], so you do not need to update them separately.**

**In addition, the various functions provided by the Manager page can be applied and immediately reflected in the app.**

**- What needs to be updated?**

**\*App Basics – Modify app name, icon, standby screen image**

**\*Design Themes - Prototypes and skin color modifications require app updates.**

Therefore, press the \[Update App] button to recreate the app in a new version.

The modifications are reflected accordingly when you are updated to a newly created version.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Important\***</mark>** Soft updates are not officially provided by Apple and Google.**

Therefore, **users who have released an app to the Play Store or the App Store are advised not to use the soft update, but to proceed with the → Hard Update, and then update the newly created version of the app to the Store.**

When making a soft update, you can receive sanctions such as the deletion of apps according to the rules of the Play Store and App Store.

The Swing2App does not take responsibility for this option, so be sure to check the contents before proceeding.
