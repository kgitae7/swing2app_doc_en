**Setting app device mode**

**+Device mode refers to switching the mobile phone screen.**

**+You can choose to create the app screen portrait or landscape only.**

The default app setting created in Swing2App is \[Horizontal-Vertical Composite], so you can rotate the app screen freely.

If you want to see only the landscape mode or portrait mode depending on the app, you can change the app screen to landscape or portrait mode in the advanced settings – device mode.

If you look at your app, apps created in landscape mode will have the app screen in landscape mode as soon as you launch it.

The screen automatically switches to horizontally.

Landscape mode is not a separate development.

You can build landscape mode apps with advanced setup options provided by Swing2App.

Please switch the app screen to see how to create an app.
