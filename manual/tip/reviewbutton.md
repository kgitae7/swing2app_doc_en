On Android phones, there’s a back button. You can close this app by pressing this button.

<mark style="color:red;">\*The review button is not applicable to the iPhone, so it is only applicable to Android phones!</mark>

When you activate the Review button, you’ll see a pop-up on your phone that will encourage you to leave a review before you exit the app.

If you press the back button to exit the app, a closing popup will appear and a review activation prompt will appear to leave a review.

**When the user selects the Leave a Review button, they will be taken to the Google Play Store app landing page.**

**Users who have released the app on the Play Store don’t need to link it separately because the link to the app launched will automatically link to the review feature!**

The review button is an optional feature, so if you want to use it, please set it separately.

You can also select \[Soft Update] as the app update type.

If you’re having trouble updating your app on the Play Store, you can just select Soft Update and re-launch the app.

If the app is built in a new version and you run the app again, you can see the review button before exiting the app.



**\[Update TIP Type]**

<mark style="color:orange;">**\*Soft update: Even if you don’t reload the app (APK file) in the store, it will update itself by simply re-launching the app.**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**\*Hard Update: You need to update the app by reloading it in the store to reflect in the app.**</mark>

Therefore, if the app is released to the Play Store or App Store, it is hard to update.

You must upload the new version of the app in the store to update it, and the app downloaded by users will also be updated.
