# File attachment in editor to upload reports, e-paper, e-magazines, instruction manual, etc.

Sometimes we wish to share e-book, e-magazine, big reports, etc. with our users through our application instead of writing a big blog with so much data. To solve the issue Swing2App provided the file attachment function where admin can attach upto 5MB file of any format (.doc, .xml, .txt, .pdf, etc.) with the users.



<mark style="color:purple;">Let’s check out the function with some example:.</mark>&#x20;

**Sample 1. The Economist(newspaper)**

**File Attachment**   Weekly e-magazine of 17 pages in .pdf format\
**Editor**   Normal post editor (Swing2App express editor)



Admin will attach the file in app to be shared with the users of the app where they can download the file easily from the app. [**Guide to create bulletin board**](../appmanage/board/create-bulletinboard.md)
