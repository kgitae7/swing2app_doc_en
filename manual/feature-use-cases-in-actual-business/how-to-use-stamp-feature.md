2\. Stamps can be used for marking the presence of the guests. So the event owner can create an app for the fashion week event and can distribute it to the users as per the guest list. Now admin will issue a visiting stamp as per the guest list who are invited for the event. So whenever a verified user’s QR code is scanned it will be collected and later on admin can check who all visited the event.
