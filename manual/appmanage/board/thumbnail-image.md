**Registering Board Thumbnail Image**

**★What is a bulletin board?**

When writing the bulletin board, you can use the first image as a thumbnail.

Thumbnails are representative images shown on the main board.

The **image shown as a representative on the bulletin board list screen is** called a **thumbnail image**.

**The image is applied as the thumbnail of the first registered image when you post.**

**\*If you do not attach an image separately, the app icon image will be shown.**

Please check the manual on how to register the thumbnail image on the bulletin board.

Occasionally, an image is registered but you may not see the thumbnail image.

To make it appear as the representative thumbnail image, you have to register the image in the body of the post.

<mark style="color:orange;">**You must register the image as a file by selecting the attach ‘Photo’ button above the title.**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Only then images registered on the board list page will be shown as representative thumbnails.**</mark>

\*\*If you don’t see the ‘Attach Picture’ button in your post, you may not have set this option when you created the bulletin board.



1. Go to **Manager.**
2. Select **Services.**
3. Click on **Bulletin Board** and click on **Create a Bulletin Board.**
4. Select **Thumbnail** style.
5. Allow **Permission setting** for **Allowed** and **Add Photo.**
6. Click on **Save.**
