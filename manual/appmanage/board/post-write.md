<mark style="color:green;">**2. Important Post Management Information**</mark>

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bc2.png)

When writing a post, you can see options such as \[Photo, Video, File].

In some bulletin boards, you can’t see the above functions. You can do it.

The reason is that the above functions can be set manually by each user when creating a bulletin board as an optional feature.

If you don’t see the features, go to \[Board Management] and press the Bulletin Board \[Settings] button to edit the allowable range settings.

Bulletin board and function setting window – Please check the \[Allowed] setting.

You can choose video attachment, photo attachment, or file attachment.

**-Photo = Attach photo**

**-Video= Video**

**-File, music = Attach file (If you select Attach file, the file and music functions are created together)**

**-Link is a fixed function.**

\* Attaching comments, likes, and comment photos is not a function used in post-management, but a function used in a comment window within the app.

\*The functions applied to post management are three functions: video attachment, file attachment, and photo attachment!

### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP. 2 Write a post in the app**</mark>

* You can install the free version of the app as well as the apps released on the App Store and Play Store with your phone (Android phone available) or check with a preview.

If you select the button, the post page opens like the image attached to the right.

You can write a body text and attach an image by selecting the left button at the bottom.

When writing is completed, select the bottom right button to complete saving.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Instructions**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**When attaching images in the app, you can only select 5 images at a time.**</mark>&#x20;

**On the web’s app operation page, you can select all 100 at a time, but on a mobile phone, the photos are very large and it takes a long time to load the app.**&#x20;

**Therefore, we limit the number of uploads to one at a time to speed uploading.**

**Similarly, you can attach up to 100 post-attached images, so **<mark style="color:red;">**if you need to attach more than 5, please register your images by dividing them into 5 images.**</mark>&#x20;





<mark style="color:blue;">**2. Edit, delete, and share posts**</mark>
