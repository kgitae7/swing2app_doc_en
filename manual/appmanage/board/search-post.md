**How to use search post**

Integrated post search is to find all the posts in the bulletin board that has been applied to the app.

For each bulletin board, you can find the post you want by entering the search terms above.

If you apply the **Search Post** menu, you can search and show the search terms in the entire bulletin board.

See how to use the post search menu.
