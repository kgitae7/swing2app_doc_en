# Search Post Functions

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/구분선 (1).PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Integrated post search is to find all the posts in the bulletin board that has been applied to the app.

For each bulletin board, you can find the post you want by entering the search terms above.

If you apply the **Search Post** menu, you can search and show the search terms in the entire bulletin board.

See how to use the post search menu.

## &#x20;**** 1. Search for individual boards-posts

On the bulletin board, the search box is set by default.

Therefore, **the function of searching for posts on a specific board is automatically provided for each board without adding a separate one.**

If you tap the 'magnifying glass' icon in the upper right corner of the board list screen, a window will pop up where you can enter a search term.

The search function for a specific board does not need to be applied separately, <mark style="color:red;">but when you create a board, \[Enter search term] is automatically placed at the top of the board.</mark>

If you tap the 'magnifying glass' icon at the top of the board list screen, a search term input window appears.

If you tap after entering a search word, it will filter and display the search terms entered in the board.
