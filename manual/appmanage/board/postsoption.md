1. **The copied and moved posts will be operated as separate posts from the original post.**\
   This means that editing the original post will not be reflected in the copied post, and editing the copied post won’t affect the original post.\
   If you delete a copied post, the original post won’t be deleted. (And vice versa)
2. **Copied posts also occupied the same capacity.**\
   Yes) If you copy 20MB of posts, they will be increased by the same amount.
3. **You can select multiple posts to copy, but you can’t select multiple target bulletin boards (posts pasted).**
4. **Posts cannot be copied to the same bulletin board.**

For example, you should not copy posts from bulletin boards back to bulletin boards, but you can copy them to other bulletin boards.
