Access to bulletin boards – you can set different users for writing, detail view, and view lists.

You can make the bulletin board available to all app users! Depending on the app, you may need to set up a group differential for the use of bulletin boards!

**For example**

**Write = Only available for administrators, view bulletin board list/view details = User only**

**Write = Only available to users, view bulletin board list/view details = Guests only**

In this way, you can specify different groups of users depending on the bulletin board.

<mark style="color:orange;">**2.View Details: Set User Permissions**</mark>

Similarly, the app was run as a guest, and I set the ‘User’ permission to the post detail view.

In this case, you can view the list of bulletin boards without restrictions, but if you select a post and try to view the details, you will see a pop-up window that prevents access and requires you to log in.
