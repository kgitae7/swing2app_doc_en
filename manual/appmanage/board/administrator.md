# Set Up a Board Administrator

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/구분선 (1).PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**★ What is a bulletin board administrator?**

Rather than operating the app as a whole, it allows you to manage a specific bulletin board, so you can select a specific member on the bulletin board and set it as an administrator.

If you are set as a board administrator, you have the right to delete a post written by another user or pin them.

In this manual, we will guide you on how to set the board administrator and how to apply the administrator through the app launch screen.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**\*Note**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">Only the selected bulletin board has administrator privileges.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">(This is not to be applied to all the board)</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">If you want to manage all the bulletin boards, you’ll need to go into all the bulletin board settings applied to the app, select the member, and save them.</mark>&#x20;
{% endhint %}



This completes the board administrator setup.

The Bulletin Board Manager may have multiple members. (There is no limit)

And the administrator settings are automatically reflected in the app, so when you run the app, it is reflected!

When running the app, you must be logged in with an account that has been designated as an administrator.

In posts written by other users, you can check the <mark style="color:blue;">**\[Delete, Pin this post, Share]**</mark> menu by selecting the three dots at the top.\
In the bulletin board applied as an administrator, you can delete a post registered by another user or pin them.

<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ What happens if I’m not a bulletin board administrator?**</mark>

If you are not a general user or a bulletin board administrator**,** you can only check the **Report** and **Share** menu.

The bulletin board manager is used to give the administrator permission only to a specific bulletin board.\
Administrators who manage the entire app works differently than the secondary administrator, please refer to the use.\
If you want to have an app administrator, please apply as a secondary administrator.
