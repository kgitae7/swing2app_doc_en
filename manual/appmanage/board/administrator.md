![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bb11-1.png)

**★ What is a bulletin board administrator?**

Rather than operating the app as a whole, it allows you to manage a specific bulletin board, so you can select a specific member on the bulletin board and set it as an administrator.

If you are set as a board administrator, you have the right to delete a post written by another user or pin them.

In this manual, we will guide you on how to set the board administrator and how to apply the administrator through the app launch screen.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Note: Only the selected bulletin board has administrator privileges. (This is not to be applied to all the board) If you want to manage all the bulletin boards, you’ll need to go into all the bulletin board settings applied to the app, select the member, and save them.**</mark> \


> This completes the board administrator setup.\
> The Bulletin Board Manager may have multiple members. (There is no limit)\
> And the administrator settings are automatically reflected in the app, so when you run the app, it is reflected!\
> When running the app, you must be logged in with an account that has been designated as an administrator.

**The bulletin board manager is used to give the administrator permission only to a specific bulletin board.**\
**Administrators who manage the entire app works differently than the secondary administrator, please refer to the use.**\
**If you want to have an app administrator, please apply as a secondary administrator.**
