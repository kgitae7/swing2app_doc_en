You can copy an existing post to another bulletin board as it is.

You can select individual posts or select multiple posts at once and copy them to a specific bulletin board.\

You can also use the ‘Copy Board’ to copy the whole board to another board.&#x20;

Please refer to the manual on how to copy the board.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**4. App Launch screen – Check the bulletin board posts**</mark>

If you check the copied bulletin board after copying the post, you can see that the post has been successfully copied to the bulletin board!

<mark style="color:orange;">**Guide**</mark>

1. **The copied and moved posts are operated as separate posts.**\
   This means that editing an original post will not be reflected in the copied post, and editing a copied post will not affect the original post.\
   Deleting a copied post does not delete the original post. (And Vice Versa)
2. **Copied posts also occupy the same capacity.**\
   Ex: If you copy a 20MB post, it will be increased by the same amount.&#x20;
3. **You can select multiple posts to copy, but you cannot multi-select target bulletin boards.**
4. **Posts cannot be copied to the same bulletin board.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}



For example, you can’t copy a post from review boards back to review boards, but you can copy it to another bulletin board.

Previously, only the board copy function was provided.

Bulletin board copy was not a daily copy of the desired posts, it was a menu that moves the entire bulletin board to another bulletin board.

**So by complementing that feature, you can select the posts you want to copy one by one or multi-select posts to another post.**&#x20;
