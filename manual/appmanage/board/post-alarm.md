****

**▶What is the new alarm?**

When a new post is registered on the bulletin board, it is a function to notify in the real-time push that the new post has been registered.

If you select a member who wants to receive an alarm in \[Bulletin administrator page], a push alarm will be sent to the member.

Therefore, the app manager does not necessarily send a new post-alarm.

You must specify a member to receive a new alarm separately. Please don’t forget.

Please check the manual on how to set a new alarm and how notifications are sent through the app launch screen.

## <mark style="color:blue;">**4. Post alarm push confirmation**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ When the post is written on the bulletin board, a notification push will be sent to the app.**</mark>

Like the image below, when a post is written on a bulletin board that applies a new post alarm, a push notification is sent to the member.\
Selecting push notifications will take you to that bulletin board-post.&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ What if you didn’t see the notification right away?**</mark>

If you didn’t see the push notification right away, you can check the notification list by selecting the notification number badge on the main home screen that appears when you launch the app.\
In other words, if you select the number badge on the main home screen after running the app as shown in the image below, the list of notifications sent will pop up.\
Selecting push notifications will take you to that bulletin post.

Push notification number badges can be found in addition to regular alarm notifications.\
Therefore, you can use this feature to check if other push notifications can be useful.

> \[Post Alarm] is a feature that has been upgraded by enhancing the function of the existing alarm push. \
> Previously, when someone commented on or liked your post, you were sent a push notification.\
> However, the newly updated post alarm function will be sent a push notification for all posts registered on the bulletin board.\
> Therefore, the administrator who manages the app can receive the news in real time, so the app can operate more efficiently.
