<mark style="color:red;">**★ Use TIP**</mark>

When setting permissions, click the arrow button in the box to select a level.\
The reason why you see so many ratings like the image below is that you created a separate membership level.\
Generally, the rating is provided by setting as a guest, user, or administrator.\

<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ View post permissions: Set as user**</mark>

When you select a post on the bulletin board, you will see a message window indicating that you need to log in as in the image above.

Since it in the below screen, the user was a guest, so it was prompted to log in as a user.

**If you do not have this level, you can set to not use it.**

Likewise, when the user selects ‘View’ as the board list permission, the guest is not accessible and will be asked to log in.

By setting permissions on the bulletin board, you can operate the bulletin board access according to the level.&#x20;
