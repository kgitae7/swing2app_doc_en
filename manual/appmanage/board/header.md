One of the bulletin board features: We will tell you how to use the bulletin board header.

Please check how to set the bulletin board header, how to set the header, and how to sort them in order.

<mark style="color:blue;">**▶ What is a bulletin board header?**</mark>

**As you can see from the image above, the bulletin board header is a pin that pins the post to the top.**

At the top of the bulletin board, you’ll see the post thumbnail, so you can see the list of posts only with thumbnails without looking at the list.

You can sort the post thumbnails in order by ranking the registered posts.
