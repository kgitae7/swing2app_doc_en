**How to copy board**

Copy Board is a function that allows you to copy a post from one board to another.

For example, if you copy a notice board to a free bulletin board, the post in the announcement is a feature that is copied to the free bulletin board.

It is really simple and not too much to use, so please check the copy board manual.
