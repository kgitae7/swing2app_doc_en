<mark style="color:orange;">**\* The first thing you need to do is to allow comments on the board.**</mark>

Comments are an optional board feature, so if you need an administrator, you can enable or disable the ‘Comments’.

Therefore, if you want to use comments in the bulletin board posts, first, you should enable the Comments in Permission Settings on the bulletin board you have created or newly created.



### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.1 To set comments on the board**</mark>

1. Go to **Manager** and select **Services.** Select **Bulletin Board** from the drop-down list.
2. Click on **Create Bulletin Board.** (If you want to create a new bulletin board, click the **Create bulletin board** button, and if you want to edit the existing bulletin board, click **Settings** button in-front of that bulletin board.
3. Select **Customize** so that you can set the further setting as per your wish.
4. Enable **Comments** in **Permission settings.**
5. Click on **Save**.
