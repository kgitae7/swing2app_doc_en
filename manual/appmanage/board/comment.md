<mark style="color:orange;">**\* The first thing you need to do is to allow comments on the board.**</mark>

Comments are an optional board feature, so if you need an administrator, you can enable or disable the ‘Comments’.

Therefore, if you want to use comments in the bulletin board posts, first, you should enable the Comments in Permission Settings on the bulletin board you have created or newly created.
