# How to write a bulletin board

**How to write a bulletin board**

**▶ What is the Bulletin Board?**\
If there is a list of answers that all users should receive,\
the administrator can provide the users with the questionnaire on the bulletin board in advance.\
\
**▶How is it different from the bulletin board form?**\
The filling form is an updated feature in the writing.\
Like the article, the administrator sets the items to be answered.\
The difference is since the bulletin board form is provided **a tool is created in the bulletin board and you can use it by adding an image or adding a calendar (date setting).**

Bulletin board writing is to set a form for writing, and users can enter text according to the form.

If you set the default text to match the characteristics of the bulletin board, the bulletin board can become a more active communication space. ^^
