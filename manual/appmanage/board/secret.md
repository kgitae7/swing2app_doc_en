# Create a Secret Bulletin Board (1:1 Customer Service)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/구분선.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A secret bulletin board is a 1:1 customer service style that can only be viewed and answered by administrators, and other users will not be able to see what is written on the bulletin board.

Only the user who created the post and the administrator can check it, so users using the app can easily write on the bulletin board.

In particular, you can write a piece of personal information that should not be seen by others, and because the administrator can immediately check and reply, it is a bulletin board style that can be useful in apps that require communication with customers.

Please read the manual below to find out how to make a secret bulletin board (1:1 Customer Service).

On the contrary, if you log in as a user other than the user who wrote the post and go to the 1:1 inquiry board, there will be no post.

Only administrators can view the posts on the bulletin board.
