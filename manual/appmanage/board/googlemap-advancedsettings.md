<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ What is the Google Maps bulletin board?**</mark>

It is a bulletin board that registers the location and informs you of the address, and I use Google Maps in conjunction with the app.

When you need to put a business address when creating an application\~!! It is a location registration function that can be used when you need to provide maps and directions to customers.

The map bulletin board not only provides a map, but also allows you to enter a variety of detailed information such as the address of the company, description of the company, directions, homepage, phone calls, and photos (images).

\*Please refer to the manual for how to use the Google Maps bulletin board!

(2) This is a screen in which the initial display format is ‘satellite’. It is displayed as a satellite image based on your current location.

The advanced settings of the location registration (map) bulletin board provided by Swing2App are not required.

It is displayed as the default even if it is not set.

\-The default is set to the user’s current location when running the location registration board, and the screen display method is’Map’.

Therefore, you do not need to use advanced settings when using the basic style.

If you want to change the style, you can set the display method, position, and zoom level.
