# How to create a Form in Bulletin Board

**▶ What is the bulletin board form?** &#x20;

If you put the questionnaire that the administrator wants, it is a bulletin board function that is provided in the set form.

In other words, if you apply a question item of your choice within the bulletin board, you can create a form that allows users to create an answer that matches the question.

When you receive a job application or receive surveys from users, you can use the corresponding form.

> \*\*Among the functions similar to the writing form is the ability to write a bulletin board.
>
> The writing form is a bit different from the writing style.&#x20;
>
> Post is a style that only posts on the bulletin board without a form.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Precautions**</mark>

When writing a form, the title displayed on the bulletin board is set as the title of the first item answer of the form.

For example, if the first item is a name, the user name is displayed as the title.

If the date is the first item, then the date is 2020-07-09.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*\*Please do not register image registration, file attachment, etc. as the first item.**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">Because there is no value to be entered in the item, the temporary automatic numeric number is set as the title.</mark>
