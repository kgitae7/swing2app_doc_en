## STEP4. Group Chat Q\&A

****

**Q. Can users select other users to chat within the app?**

Selecting users or inviting them to a room is not supported.



**Q. How do app users know if I have a conversation in a group chat room?**

Users who have accessed (entered) a group chat room even once will receive a conversation push notification from the app.&#x20;

If you select push notifications, you can enter the chat room.&#x20;

However, users who have not logged in will not receive push notifications, so they will not be able to check their conversation history.



**Q. So how can I notify users of group chats? Or can I announce that I can join a group chat room?**

Allows the administrator to send pushes.

&#x20;Please use the function provided by the Swing2App app operation → push delivery, not chat push.

If you select the Link Wizard when sending a push, you can set the link as a group chat room.

When you select a push that users receive from your app, they are taken directly to the group chat room, so you can engage them in that way.

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EA%B7%B8%EB%A3%B9%EC%B1%84%ED%8C%8512\_20.06.png)

However, as mentioned above, <mark style="color:green;">the number of people accessing is determined according to the product, so only the number of people listed in the applied product can access it.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;"></mark>

**Q. Does the group chat room always require an administrator to be in order to operate?**

Since it is not an admin chat, only users can enter to use it.&#x20;

In addition to the administrator, users can chat in groups.



**Q. How do I delete a chat room conversation?**

If you press the \[Settings] button at the top right of the chat window, there is a menu to delete chat history.&#x20;

If you select the menu, you can delete the conversation history.&#x20;

If you leave and enter again after deletion, the conversation history is deleted.



**Q. What if I don't want to receive push conversations?**

If you press the \[Settings] button in the upper right corner of the chat window, there is a push notification on/off button.&#x20;

You can select the menu to turn off the notification setting.
