**How to use Google Map Board**

In addition to the general location registration board that works with the following map, we will show you how to use the location registration board using Google Maps.

<mark style="color:red;">**\*For Google Maps, you will need to apply on a separate Google Map platform and use it.**</mark>

> 1. Google Maps is not a free service, but a service provided by Google’s own platform for a fee.
> 2. In order to integrate Google Maps into your own apps, you need to sign up at the Google Maps platform site and get a key value called API. (Enter the API key value into the Swing2App Google Map board to link it). Only then can users use Google Maps normally.&#x20;
> 3. Because Google Maps is a paid service, you must pay a fee to the Google Maps platform.&#x20;
>
> &#x20;\*It is a pay-as-you-go plan, and you are only billed for what you use.

**Please check the post on how to get a Google Map API key.**
