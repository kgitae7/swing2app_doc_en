when stamp registration is completed as many as the number set by the administrator, all the stamps are reset (disappears) and a pop-up window appears that a coupon has been issued.

Select OK to see a list of coupons is issued by your users.

***

If you create a stamp without selecting the coupon issuing function, the coupon **screen will not be reset** even if 10 pieces are filled, **and the same 10 pieces remain.**

Therefore, the administrator had to manage the way by deleting the 10 pieces after searching the members in the swing2app stamp management screen.

And I had to go to the coupon management page and send the member a free drink coupon. (It’s pretty complicated.)

**If you select \[Issued coupon upon completion of stamp]**

**\*Once all the stamps set by the administrator are stamped, the user’s app will automatically reset all the stamps to the empty screen.**

**\* Also, you will automatically be issued a coupon set by your administrator to your app.**
