## STEP4.  Notice Board&#x20;

1\) If you are new on Swing2App, you do not have to create a bulletin board.

You have been provided with default boards which you can edit and use as per the need.

2\)When using the bulletin board, you must attach an image to set the representative thumbnail image.

When using the bulletin board, there is an inquiry that thumbnail images are not displayed on the bulletin board list page and are displayed as app icons.

The invisible image is because there is no attached image.

When specifying a thumbnail image for a post, be sure to select \[Attach photo] to attach an image file.

If you attached an image into the text (body), the image is recognized as text and cannot be specified as a thumbnail.

**Therefore, when you specify a thumbnail image in the post, please register as an attached image.**&#x20;
