**Batch Board** is a function not only to register a single bulletin board, but it also allows you to register posts on multiple bulletin boards of your choice.

In other words, if you want to post the same post on multiple bulletin boards, you can register them all at once by using the **Batch Board.**



### <mark style="color:blue;">**1. Move the Bulk registration bulletin board**</mark>

1. Go to **Manager.**
2. Select **Posts.**
3. Click on **Batch Board** from the list.

Batch Board is the default board provided by Swing2App. Therefore, you do not need to add a separate post-management menu, go to the bulk registration bulletin board and work.
