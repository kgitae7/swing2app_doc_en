<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/구분선.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<mark style="color:purple;">**\*\*Notes on file attachment\*\***</mark>

File attachment is only available on the Swing2App web dashboard-post management.

The file attachment function is not available in the app, so if you need to register a file, please use it on the web.

When registering a post in the app – Only content (text) and images can be registered.

***

There must be a bulletin board before registering a file, right?

If you haven’t created a bulletin board yet, please create a bulletin board first!

**File attachment can be used in two ways.**

### <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png) <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.1 Board function – Using file attachment**</mark> &#x20;

The first way to attach a file is to use \[Attach File] among the functions provided on the bulletin board!&#x20;

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Group-2628.png)

There is a <mark style="color:blue;">**\[File]**</mark> button in the blue line at the top of the post creation page.

Click the button to load and register files saved in My Computer.

<mark style="color:red;">\*Caution\*</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">When registering a file, the capacity cannot exceed 5MB. Please pay attention to the capacity and register!</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">Files can be uploaded without a limit on the number of files provided they do not exceed the size.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

> <mark style="color:purple;">“I don’t see the file button in the blue area!” Those who do this are because the file attachment is not checked in the bulletin board function.</mark>
>
> Please check the method below and correct it.

Files registered by this method are registered in the form of attachments, so the file is placed at the bottom of the body.

**The second way to attach a file is to use the \[Upload File] button in the HTML editor’s writing bar.**

Writing – If you select HTML Editor, an option bar is created in the text..

**When attaching a file in this way, you can freely write a post because the file is attached to the body of the post.**

As you can see in the attached image, you can freely place file attachments under the text or under the image.
