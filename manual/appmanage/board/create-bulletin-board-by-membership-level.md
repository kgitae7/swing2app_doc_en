# Create bulletin board by membership level

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pg.png)

**What is the bulletin board by grade?**\
When you use a bulletin board, you can split your membership level and use it when you want to give permission to use the bulletin board.\
For example, a school teacher should be able to see and write on all bulletin boards.\
And if you have bulletin boards in the first, second, and third grades, you can only use the third-grader without access to the third-grade board.\
In this case, it is to set the permission to use the bulletin board by giving a rating to each member.\
Therefore, dividing ratings by member and setting up bulletin boards is a frequent feature in the app.\
\
**Instruction to use**

1. Set up a group of members (create a grade to use among 1 – 9 grades).
2. Apply a grade to a member to what grade to apply to each member.
3. Once you have set up the membership grade, set the authority for each grade on the board.
