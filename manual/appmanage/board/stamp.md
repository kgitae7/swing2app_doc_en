![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/app\_stamp.png)

**▶ What is the stamp function provided by Swing2App?**

In Swing2App, you can stamp with a mobile coupon built into the app, not a paper coupon.

The administrator can add a stamp with the membership number issued by the app, or you can add it by taking a QR code.

If you run the app provided by the company without the hassle of carrying a coupon, you can immediately get a stamp!

**Since it is a function provided as a bulletin board, you can select the stamp UI in the bulletin board management and reflect it in the app.**
