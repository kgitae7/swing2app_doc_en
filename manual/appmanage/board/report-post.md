Reporting posts is a necessary feature to make your app more orderly and comfortable to run with a lot of people.

* Users can report inappropriate posts in the app to the administrator.
* Administrators can check posts that have been reported on the app operation page \[report management] to delete or cancel the report.

Report Post – We’ll report the post and let you know the process.
