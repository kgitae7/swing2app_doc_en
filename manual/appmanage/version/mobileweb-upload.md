**What is mobile web registration?**

Mobile web registration is useful for those who don’t have a website.

It is a service that registers apps created by Swing2App by making them mobile websites.

You can register an app created by Swing2App as a mobile website.

If you purchase a separate domain, purchase a mobile web registration ticket and request to register for a mobile web, we will register the app on that website.

1\. The mobile web can be used by those who do not have a website or website.

2\. The App Store review is very long (2 weeks), so if iPhone users cannot use the app, they can use the mobile web instead.

3\. If it is rejected in the App Store review, iPhone users can use the mobile web as an alternative.

4\. If you need a mobile website and the production cost is burdensome, you can use it with the app!

<mark style="color:red;">**\[Precautions for Mobile Web Registration]**</mark>\
\


**1) Before applying for mobile web registration, you must purchase a domain that can be linked with the site separately. (Cafe 24, etc.)**

After purchasing a mobile web registration ticket, apply for mobile web registration and we will register the app site with the domain.

**2) Mobile web is available only when a paid app is applied.**

You can’t use it in the free and commercial version, <mark style="color:purple;">**You can apply only when you purchase a swing expendable and premium pass.**</mark>

**3) The mobile web usage period is the same as the paid app usage period.**

Because the app is linked to the web as it is, the mobile web also ends in the same way when the paid app usage period ends.

\*If the period of using the paid app is 1 month, the mobile web is also available for 1 month, and the mobile web is automatically extended when re-paying for the paid app subscription.

**4) Users who have applied for and are using the free commercial version cannot apply. \*Available only for paid apps**

**5) It is not compatible with PC because it is a mobile web.**

The website will also open on PC, but not suitable for PC as the screen resolution is made for mobile.

**6) Even if the app is updated, it is not reflected in the mobile web.**

If you need to change the web with the updated content, please purchase a mobile web upload ticket and apply for the newly updated version.

**7) When registering on the mobile web, it is not searchable on the portal site.**

You must apply separately for the search service provided by the portal site.

Swing2App only performs mobile web registration/ does not perform service registration such as search service and keyword exposure.
