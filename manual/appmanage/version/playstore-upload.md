**How to Apply for Google Play Store Upload**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q. What if I want to post a Swing2App app on the Play Store?**</mark>

First, you need to make a paid conversion so that the app can be placed on the market.

You can purchase the Play Store upload ticket along with the payment of the swing2app paid ticket on the Manager page → Online Stores → Swing2App Voucher and Ticket Purchase page.

Then the app will go to the market… Think about it!

**Just because you made a payment does not mean your app will be released on the Play Store.**

**\[Apply for Play Store upload] can be registered in the market after the representative checks the app.**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q. Where and how do I apply for upload?**</mark>

Application for upload goes to the swing2app Manager page → Manage Version → Production History.

You can find \[Play Store Upload Request] on this page.

Pressing the corresponding button brings up the application form window.

**Please fill out the form and the representative will upload the app to the Play Store.**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q. When I upload, will the app be released to the Play Store immediately?**</mark>

We will upload the app to the Play Store on behalf of Swing2App.

It will not be released immediately but will be first reviewed by Google Apps.

**Google app review takes 1 to 3 days. Therefore, uploading does not mean that your app will be released immediately.**

**If there are no issues after the review, we will launch to the store normally after the review period.**

However, the release time may be longer because it may be rejected.

**\*Before applying to upload Play Store, please make sure you have a Google Developer account**.

The Play Store requires a user’s Google Developer account to register.&#x20;

If you do not have a developer account, please make a $25 payment through [https://play.google.com/apps/publish/](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) Developer Console site.

<mark style="color:orange;">**★ Please refer to the manual on how to upload the App Store!!**</mark>

   If you refuse to upload, we will send you an email with your rejection and action. \* Re-examination will be conducted at no additional cost.\
   \-If you receive an email, you must reply to the action to proceed with the review. If you do not reply within a week, the upload will be placed on hold. (If you have any pending registration, please contact us again and we will proceed with the review)
