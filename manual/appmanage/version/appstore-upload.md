**How to Apply for App Store Upload**

After creating a swing2app app, if you apply for an app store upload to release a paid version app on the app store, we will upload the app from the agency.



<mark style="color:blue;">**Q. What if I want to post a Swing2App app on the App Store?**</mark>

First, you need to make a paid conversion so that the app can be placed on the market.

**Manager page → Online Stores → Buy Vouchers & Tickets, ticket purchase page, you can purchase the e-store upload ticket with the swing2app paid ticket payment.**

Then the app will go to the market. Think about it!

**Just because you made a payment does not mean that your app will be released to the store.**

**\[App Store upload request] can be registered by the representative in the market after checking the app.**



<mark style="color:blue;">**Q. Where and how do I apply for upload?**</mark>

**The application for uploading is moved to the Swing2App Manager Page → Manage Version → Production History page.**

You can check \[App store upload application] on this page.

​Pressing the corresponding button brings up the application form window.

**Please fill out the ‘Request’ form so that the representative can upload your app to the App Store!**



<mark style="color:blue;">**Q. If I upload, will the app be released to the App Store immediately?**</mark>

We will upload your app to the App Store on behalf of Swing2App.

It will not be released immediately but will be reviewed by Apple.

**App store review takes about 1 week – 2 weeks. \* Please note that Apple has a long review period.**

**Therefore, uploading does not mean that your app will be released immediately.**

**If there are no issues after the review, we will launch to the store normally after the review period.**

However, the release time may be longer because it may be rejected.
