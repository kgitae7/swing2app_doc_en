**Manage Version – Production history, Market registration, Market Records**

**\* What is the Manage Version menu?**

The Manage Version provided by the Swing2App is a menu that allows you to view information such as the history of the app and the history of the market.

In particular, on the **Production History** page, you can download the APK file and apply for the Play Store/App Store upload.

Since it is a management page for app operation, it is not particularly difficult.

You can check the features of each menu.
