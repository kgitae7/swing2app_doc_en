Chat list is a useful feature for those who use 1:1 chat(admin chat).&#x20;

When a member of the app sends a message in the chat room, admin can see a number badge appears in-front of the corresponding person. Admin can quickly check the contents by clicking through the number badge, web notifications, etc. through the chat administrator page.

Users can check the chat list of members on the list page to send and receive messages directly.&#x20;

1. **Notification Number Badge**\
   When a user sends a message to an administrator in the chat room, they see a notification number badge.\

   When you select a member who sent you a message on the chat list page, a chat window pops up so that you can chat on the web. Administrators can chat with users from the web.
