**Sign up-Set ID**

The membership registration form required to sign up for the app can also be modified by the operator by setting it directly on the dashboard.

At this time, the id form is provided as a basic setting with a general ID (English, number, etc.).

If you want to change the form of the ID, you can change it to a phone number or email in addition to the normal ID.

Please check with the manual on how to set the ID type in the registration form and how the ID input screen is changed through the app execution screen.

Please do not change the ID type while the app is running (store distribution or apps being used by users).

If you change your ID, there may be restrictions on the login of existing members.

Initially, the ID type: set to a normal ID, but when changing to ‘email’, the user who previously registered as an ID logs out and logs in again

If you try to log in, the ID type will change and you will not be able to log in.

Therefore, do not change the ID during operation.

We recommend that you use it while testing while making the app.
