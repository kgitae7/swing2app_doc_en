Chat lists are available to users (app members) after a 1:1 admin chat, and you can check the admin chat list.

Due to the nature of the app, if multiple app administrator (sub-administrator) operate, the user can chat with multiple administrators.

Administrators can search and talk to users on the member inquiry or webchat page.

Users can check the administrator chat list in the chat list and select an administrator to talk with.

**Chat List is a 1:1 administrator chat menu where you can see the list by the administrator, and app members (users) can see the chat list for each administrator.**

\-As shown in the image above, the chat list is displayed separately for each administrator to see which administrator the user has chatted with.

\-Therefore, after ending the chat, the user can enter the chat list and select an administrator to chat with.

After the admin chat, the user can re-enter the chat room to see the chat list.

The chat room is not divided into administrators because all administrators are shown by the integration.

**\*The chat room will only show the admin public chat list, and the admin-only chat list will not be shown.**

Therefore, it was difficult for the user to determine which administrator they were chatting with, and the user may feel uncomfortable to ask again which administrator they were chatting with.

However!! Now you can use the Chat List to see a list of each administrator you’ve talked about.

<mark style="color:red;">\*If you want to contact the ‘Kim Swing2App’ administrator who has the last chat with you among the chat administrators, you can select the ‘Kim Swing2App’ administrator from the chat list to start chatting.</mark>

So you can always talk to the administrators you want to chat with on the list.

<mark style="color:red;">\* \[Integrated administrator chat] in the chat list, you can check the chat history of the ‘public conversation’ instead of ‘private conversation’ when the administrator chats.</mark>
