**How to use the Analytics menu**

**“Analytics” gives you more control over your apps so you can see how they’re aggregated over time, including app users, members, and page views.**

You can check the information required to run the app, so if you want to check the statistics related to the app, please check from the menu.

Please check the manual on how to use the statistics function.
