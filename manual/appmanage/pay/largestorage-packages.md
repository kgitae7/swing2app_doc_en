​**\* Large Storage Package products are recommended for long-term operation of many apps, commercialization of stores, or when you need to use a lot of app capacity.**

**\* If you need more app capacity, 30GB is added at a time without having to purchase it individually! (2GB of app capacity is provided when purchasing a single item of a basic pass)**



1\) A voucher (package product) that converts a free app into a paid version, and is purchased when commercialized in markets such as Play Store and App Store.

2\) The large-capacity package provides \[1 year subscription for Swing2App Basic Paid App + App Store upload ticket + Play Store upload ticket + 30 GB app capacity added].

It is offered at a discount of $557 compared to purchasing as an individual product. $~~1,107~~ → $550

3\) In the Large Storage Package, the same functions provided in the basic subscription are provided except for the app capacity.

\*Open 100 bulletin boards, 5 group chat rooms, etc

4\) For large Storage Package products, the date of use is reflected immediately upon purchase, so please use it after making the final app.

If more than one day has passed, no refund is possible, and the remaining days will not be refunded, nor will the use be withheld.

Therefore, please consider carefully before purchasing.

5\) The subscription provided in the package is a one-year subscription, and you can use the app as a paid version for 12 months (360 days).

If you want to extend the period again after that, please check the capacity you are using and purchase a ticket.

If you need 30GB of storage, you can repurchase the ‘Large Storage Package’ product, or if you do not use a lot of the app space, you can purchase the Swing2App general subscription (Basic type, Expandable type).

6\) When purchasing a ticket, the app is converted to the paid version, and the paid version of the app (APK file) can be registered and released in the Play Store/App Store.

7\) If you apply for store upload with the ticket (Play Store, App Store) you received when purchasing a package product, we will act on your behalf and upload the app to the store.

We will release it.

\*Play Store can be directly released by users, and App Store can only be uploaded by proxy.

8\) **App storage is provided with 30GB.**

If the capacity provided for the app is exceeded, the use of the app will be suspended regardless of the number of days remaining, so please always check the app capacity.

Please purchase additional capacity products before the capacity is exceeded, or secure capacity in, [Manager → Services → Manage Storage](https://swing2app.com/view/storage\_manager)&#x20;

9\) The voucher is non-refundable if the number of days of use has passed, and the remaining number of days will not be refunded or withheld.

Therefore, please consider carefully before purchasing.

10\) You can check the purchase history and period of use of the purchased ticket on the [Manager → Online Stores → Payment Status](https://www.swing2app.com/view/payment\_list)&#x20;

11\) If you do not repurchase the ticket again before the end of the paid use, the paid version will be terminated and the use of the app will be suspended.

The period of use will be extended only if you purchase the pass again before the period of use expires.&#x20;

(It is not an automatic payment, so please check the date of the period of use accurately before payment.)

12\) If you end the paid use (paid version), you can use the free version again.

Select the \[App Creation Request] button on the app creation page to create a new version.

Then the app will be remade as a free version, and you can use it as a free version.

<mark style="color:purple;">\*When converting to the free version, it is only available for personal use, so apps released in the store cannot be used.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">\*The free version of the app is 100mb in size.</mark>&#x20;

13\) From 7 days before the expiration date of the paid app usage period, the user’s e-mail and text message will notify you of the expiration date.

Emails are sent to the email registered with Swing2App, and since phone numbers are not collected separately, text messages cannot be sent to users without contact information.

14\) For Large Storage Package products and all paid products, the voucher is applied to one app.

If you want to apply a package product to three apps, you must purchase the package product separately for each app.

15\) Large Storage Package products can be purchased only in apps made with general prototypes – top, footer, slide, drop-down list & box.
