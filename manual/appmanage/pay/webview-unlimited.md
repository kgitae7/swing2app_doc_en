**▶ Prototype: What is a web view?**

Swing2App offers several styles of UI design – prototypes.

Among these, ‘Web View’ is only produced if you enter the user’s homepage URL without any other production function.

If you’re running a shopping mall and you want to create an app, it’s really simple to create.

Therefore, unlimited web view plug-in products provided by Swing2App can be used by users who have created apps with web views.&#x20;

If you have to pay a monthly fee for using the paid app, you can use the app with a monthly fee of $300 when you need to use the app for a long time. \

The web view is a prototype that creates web links by linking them to your app.

If you don’t want to create your app with the Swing2App authoring tool, you can use it to create your app with just web links.

<mark style="color:blue;">**▶ Web view features**</mark>\
\-When creating an app with a web view, you can create an app by just putting the URL address of the web link.\
\-You can’t use other menus provided by Swing2App because it only uses web links. (All menus such as push notifications and bulletin boards are not available)\

### <mark style="color:blue;">**3. Cautions when using unlimited web view plug-in**</mark>

1\) Once the **web view unlimited plug-in is applied, the web link (site URL address) applied to the app home screen cannot be changed.**

For example) [https://support.swing2app.com/](https://support.swing2app.com/), if you are creating and using the app with this URL address, you can still use the site address only.

\*During unlimited use, changes to the web link are not reflected in the app.

\
\
2\) Unlimited web view products are Swing2App custom products, so we will re-create the app with a new version after work.

Therefore**, users who have an older version of the app should update to the store again with the new version of the app.**

You will need to update the new version of the app again so existing users can receive the update.&#x20;

**New users can also use the app with unlimited web views.** \*Update is required, not optional.

\
\
3\) **Store upload tickets are not included in the web view unlimited paid app product.**

If you need to update or launch the app on the store for a new one, you must apply after purchasing an upload ticket.



4\) Do you want to change the app name, icon image, idle screen image, etc. while using the app with the web view plug-in??

Step 1. If you want to change the basic information of the app, please update it to the new version by \[App Production Request].

Apps released to the Play Store, App Store, etc. must also be updated to the new version.



**5) Prototype cannot be changed while using unlimited web views.**

Only the web view version is available and cannot be changed with a push app, so please consider carefully and purchase.



6\) **If you purchase and use a swing2app paid app subscription, and you pay for the unlimited web view plug-in, you will not be able to make a split refund for the remainder of the year.**

**Ex) Even if you have 20 days left on your total 30 days, you will not be eligible for a refund of the difference for that number of days.**&#x20;

Therefore, we recommend that you purchase an unlimited number of web view tickets immediately after creating a web view app.

If you have already purchased a paid app voucher, please use the date of purchase and purchase unlimited web view tickets. \


**7) In the app dashboard (app operation page dashboard) to which unlimited web views has been applied, it is indicated as ‘unlimited’.**

**8) If you are updating an app made by another company by switching to the web view version, please contact us before purchasing.**

(Because the keystore is different, confirmation is required)
