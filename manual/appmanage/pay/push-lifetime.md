Swing2App provides several styles of UI design-prototype.

‘Push’ only is a web app that is created by linking a website as it is with an app.

If you enter the website (homepage) URL without any other production function, it will be linked to the app and produced, and a push toolbar will be created at the bottom of the app.

Additionally, the push app can send push messages to users who have installed the app. \*Unlimited pushes are also sent.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**3. Caution**</mark>

1. **When unlimited push is applied, the web link (site URL address) applied to the app home screen cannot be changed.**\
   For example, If you create an app with the URL address https://support.swing2app.com and use it, you can continue to use it only with the site address.\
   \*Even if you change the web link address, it is not reflected in the app.
2. **For push-only unlimited setting, we have re-created the app with a new version.**\
   Users who have previously released the app must update to the corresponding version of the app on the store.\
   The new version of the app must be uploaded to the store and updated before existing users can receive the update, and new users can also use the push-only unlimited app. (Update is required, not optional.)
3. **Push-only unlimited paid apps do not include store upload tickets.**\
   If you need to update or launch the app on the store for a new one, you must apply after purchasing an upload ticket.
4. **If you want to change the app name, icon image, standby screen image, etc. while using an app with an unlimited push-only paid app??**\
   Step 1 If you want to change the basic information of the app, please update it to the new version by making \[App Creation Request] to create an app.\
   Apps released on the Play Store, App Store, etc. also need to be updated to the new version. (Play Store can be updated directly, App Store re-apply after purchasing upload ticket)
5. **Prototype cannot be changed during unlimited push-only use.**\
   Only push apps are available, and other prototype changes such as web views are not allowed while using this product, so please consider carefully and purchase.
6. **You can change the conversion by purchasing a push-only unlimited paid app product while using the Swing Paid App Pass.**\
   However, even if you purchase and use the Swing Paid App Pass, and then pay for the Push-only Unlimited Paid App, a partial refund for the remaining period is not made.\
   Example) Even if only 10 days are used out of the total number of days and 20 days remain, the number of days will expire and the difference will not be refunded.\
   Therefore, we recommend that you purchase and use the push-only unlimited paid app product immediately after creating the push app, and if you purchase a paid app license first, please use the date of use and purchase the unlimited product.\
   If you are satisfied with the non-refundable information, you can purchase unlimited push-only paid app products even while using the voucher. (You can change it immediately while using it.)
7. **In the push-only app dashboard (Manager page dashboard), it is indicated as ‘unlimited’.**
8. **If you are updating an app made by another company by switching to a push app, please contact us before purchasing.**\
   (Because the keystore is different, confirmation is required)
