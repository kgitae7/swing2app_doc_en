**What is Mobile Web Registration?**

Mobile web registration is useful for those who do not have a website.

It is a service that registers the app created in Swing2App as a mobile website.

You can register the app created in Swing2App as a mobile website. &#x20;

If you purchase a domain separately, purchase a mobile web registration ticket, and request a mobile web registration fee, we will register the app with the website.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**★ Utilization TIP**</mark>\
1\. Mobile web can be useful to those who do not have a homepage or site.\
2\. App store review is very long (2 weeks) So if the iPhone users cannot use the app, they can replace it with the mobile web.\
3\. If rejected by the App Store review, alternatively, iPhone users can use the mobile web.\
4\. If you need a mobile website and the production cost is too high, you can use it with the app.
