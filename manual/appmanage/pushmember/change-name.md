> <mark style="color:red;">**★Tip for changing the member name**</mark>
>
> **-If you have set up a group in the app, you can include the group name in the user name and separate it**
>
> **-If you have listed your nickname in an app that operates under real name, correct your name to admin rights**
>
> **-If you use the same name in your app, edit with administrator privileges**
>
> **-If you need to distinguish a specific member**

You can use it for so many purposes.

The administrator can change the names of the app members to suit the purpose of the app operation.
