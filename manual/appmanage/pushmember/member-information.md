If a member has forgotten the password used by the app, the administrator can reset the app member’s password.

<mark style="color:red;">\*In an app that uses an ID via e-mail, you can receive and use a temporary password by e-mail.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">\*Because the general ID cannot find the password, the administrator can reset it in this case.</mark>

​

**4) Account withdrawal and deletion**
