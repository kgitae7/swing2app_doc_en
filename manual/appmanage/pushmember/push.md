**Send push**

It’s easy to understand that push is an advertising message sent by the app.

It’s a promotion channel that makes it easy to deliver announcements, events, and advertisements to members who use the app.

Promote much better because it provides a link to the page containing the content you want to convey.

\-Push is also available for free when creating apps in the swing2app.

\-You can use it an unlimited number of times, no limit.

**When you send a push, a push notification is sent to the user’s mobile phone where the application is installed.**

<mark style="color:red;">\*Push must be installed on your phone, then check directly on the phone. (It won’t work for virtual machines and app previews)</mark>

Push notifications may vary in speed depending on the number of users who use the app, but they are usually sent within 3 to 10 seconds.&#x20;

**Select the push notification to go to the linked web link page.**

> <mark style="color:blue;">**The screen that Push is sent to is different for iPhone and Android phones. Please check through the image below!**</mark>

​

<mark style="color:orange;">**1) iPhone app push dispatch screen**</mark>

On the iPhone, only the push title and message contents are displayed.

Even if you register an image in Push Send, the image does not appear in the iPhone notification window.



<mark style="color:orange;">**2) Android phone app push sending screen**</mark>

On the Android phone, all titles, contents, and images registered in Push Send are displayed.

If you send a push while the app is running, it will be displayed in a popup window.

<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ Push notification**</mark>

***

<mark style="color:orange;">**▶ Push-only app push delivery**</mark>

\* Prototype: Push version app made exclusively for push has a special feature sending push.

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pm7.png)

**1)When sending a push, you cannot select a member, only a full shipment is possible.**

Push-only apps are apps created by applying a website (homepage) link to the app as it is, so there is no member to sign up in the app.

Therefore, the app can not recognize the members, so you can not select members, only the entire shipment.

All of them are marked as guests.

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2020-04-21-at-00.24.27.png)

**2)You cannot use the Link Wizard.**

Link Wizard is not available because there is no menu linked to the app.

You can only send by sending a regular web link (URL).

**Therefore, if you are using a push-only app, please make sure to send the contents when pushing. Please check.**
