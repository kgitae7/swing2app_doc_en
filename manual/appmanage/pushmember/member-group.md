**How to create a permission group and apply a rating to members**

As an administrator, you can create the groups you need for each rating and apply them to your members.

First, create a group by rating in the permission group setting, and then apply the group by selecting members on the member view page.

If you specify a group, you can set the group expiration date for that user!!

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Group-2853.png)

**\*Expiration Date: You can decide whether to use the group granted to the member for an unlimited period without a time limit or to set an expiration date by setting a period**

The group expiration date is set to ‘unlimited’ by default.

Therefore, if you use it as it is without modifying it, the member will continue to use it as a registered group.

If the administrator sets the group expiration date for the member → On the group expiration date, the group is changed to a general member (user) group.

\*General members are a group of users with a level/grade of 9 that is granted when registering as a member.

\*Group expiration date can be changed by the administrator at any time.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.3 App Launch Screen**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**\*We’ll see how the user level (group) changes in the app.**</mark>

**When a user group changes, a push notification is sent to the user.**

Please select push notifications.
