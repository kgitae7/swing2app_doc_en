If you look at the bottom of the post in the post-management, there is a push setting button.

You can also set a push for your posts using the button.

★ How do I use posts that are not registered yet and can not be pushed?

Push can be scheduled!!

So you don’t have to send a push in front of your computer every time.

You can set the reservation push for the post you want by setting the date and time of your booking.
