Membership Inquiry – How to Create a Member

<mark style="color:blue;">**▶What is creating a member?**</mark>

This is a function that the administrator uniformly creates members’ accounts and distributes them to users.

Unlike in general, users accessing the app and signing up directly! Member creation differs in that an administrator creates an ID and distributes it to users.

**▶Application examples​​**

\-When you need to distribute the app to all students of the school with an app created by the school: Create an account uniformly by student number or class number

\-When using within the company: Create an account with serial number and employee number

\-If multiple users need to use it as a test before official distribution of the app (log in with a batch created account without signing up one by one)

\-Otherwise, it can be used when you need to create a specific ID at the discretion of the administrator.

Users who received an account by creating a member can also change information such as profile image and password by editing member information.
