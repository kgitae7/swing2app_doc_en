### <mark style="color:blue;">**STEP.1 Basic Settings**</mark>

The first step in sending push is the basic settings.

Push Version App – Sending push is not available to members and can only be done in full delivery.

Push-only app is created by applying the website (homepage) link to the app, so there are no members who subscribe to the app.

As a result, the app cannot recognize members, so members cannot be selected, and only full shipments are possible.

They are all marked as ‘guests’.
