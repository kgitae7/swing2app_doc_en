![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/apk1.png)

**We’ll show you how to install apk files (apps) created by swing2app on your mobile phone.**

When you request an app production in swing2app, the app is created as an APK file.

App creation time takes about 5 to 10 minutes.

<mark style="color:blue;">**When the production is completed, the APK file will be sent to your email. (Accounts on swing2app)**</mark>

When sent by email, users can download and install apk files on their mobile phone by opening the inbox on their mobile phone.

<mark style="color:red;">\*App download is only available on Android phones. (iPhone X)</mark>

\*\*Alternatively, \*\*<mark style="color:blue;">**you can use the ‘Swing2App Preview’ app to preview the iPhone user’s app.**</mark>

After creating the app through the manual, please check how to download the app to your phone.

<mark style="color:red;">**\[Instructions]**</mark>

The free version of swing2app can be downloaded directly from your Android phone and viewed on your phone.

So, after the app is created, Android phone users can download the test app to their mobile phone and check it out.

iPhone users will not be able to see the free version of the app on the iPhone unless it is released in the App Store.

Instead, download the ‘Swing2App Preview’ app created by our swing2app and log in to see the preview.
