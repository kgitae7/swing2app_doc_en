**App – How to find your password**

If you forgot your password for your app,

You can get a temporary password and log in using the **\[Forgot Password]** function within the app.

You can reset and use your new password in Edit Membership.

<mark style="color:red;">**★ IMPORTANT: Forgot Password can be used only if ID is set to ‘Email’.**</mark>\

**Please read the manual to find out how to find your password if you forgot it.**

If you enter the \[Login] menu after running the app, there will be a \[Forgot Password] button under the Email and Password input items.

You can get a temporary password by selecting the corresponding button.

<mark style="color:red;">\* You can use the password search only if your ID is set to ‘Email’.</mark>

To find your password, we’ll send you a temporary password via email.

But you can’t send a temporary password because your regular ID isn’t an email.

**Therefore, if you are an administrator when making the first app, please make sure your ID is set to ‘Email’.**
