**We’ll show you how to share your swing2app-generated app with others.**

Apps created by Swing2app can be shared with other users without having to be released to the Store for Android, such as the Play Store.

**★ You can share apps, bulletin boards, and posts**

**★ App sharing is available in both free and paid versions. (Only available on Android phones)**

**▶Android phones**

**1)Apps created in the free version can only be shared on Android phones. (Android phone ↔ Android phone)**

2\)The app you want to share must be installed before it can be shared with other users.

3\)If you share to a user who hasn’t installed the app, they will receive a message appears asking them to install the app, and they will need to install the app to see the shared link.

4\)If the app is available in the Play Store, you can go to the Play Store and download the app.

**▶iPhone**
