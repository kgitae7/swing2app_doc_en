**\[What is app administrator menu?]**

The App Administrator menu is a service that links the most frequently used functions of the admin menu that had to be operated on the Swing2App homepage into the app.\
For example, in the past, users could chat with administrators in the app when chatting 1:1, but administrators were only available on the Swing2App homepage.\
In addition, functions such as user permission changes and member information notes are not available in the app, but only on the Swing2App homepage.

**However, all of the above features are now available in the app.**\
**We’ve also added the \[Admin menu] to the app.**\
**The frequently used admin menu is available in the app.**\
**We’ll tell you how to use the App Administrator menu and the features provided.**
