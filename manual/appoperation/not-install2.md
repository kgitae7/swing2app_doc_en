**↑↑ You will see a message that the app is not installed.**&#x20;



<mark style="color:orange;">**What is the reason?**</mark>

If you’re using the app in a paid version and you don’t want to launch it on the Play Store, Google recognizes this as an unknown path, and you’ve randomly blocked the installation, so it’s not going to be installed properly.





> **▶ Google policy changes: Why can’t I install APK files?**
>
> **We’ve made sure that APKs are distributed on Google Play, and we’ve updated our policy to ensure the apps that are not securely installed.**
>
> **Therefore, some of the paid apps created by Swing2App that are not available in the Play Store have been blocked by android phones by identifying them as unauthenticated routes.**
