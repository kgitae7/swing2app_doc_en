![](../../.gitbook/assets/1제작완료.png)

STEP1 The basic information: Users should add this information to the app creation wizard screen, and if they wish they can easily modify it on the MakerV3 screen. &#x20;

Except for the app ID, the app name, icons, and splash screen images can be modified even after the app is created.

\*STEP1- After modifying the Basic Information step, you must press the \[Update App] button to update to the new version to reflect modified items in your app.&#x20;



### ![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png) What is the image editing tool?

**The image editing tool is a feature that allows you to easily modify the size of the image.**&#x20;

**In case your register icon and splash screen image do not fit the recommended size, worry not, you can modify the size through the image editing tool.**

If the image size you want to upload when creating the app is different from the recommended image size listed in the creation method, you can easily modify the size in this editing tool.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/이미지편집도구.png)

The app icon image recommended size is **1024 x 1024 px.**

If the attached image does not match the size, a window will pop up warning that the size does not match as shown in the image above.

Click on 'OK' button to enter in the Image Editing Tool window.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/이미지편집도구3.png)

As you can see in the image, the (blue line) area is designated as the image size to be uploaded in the image editing tool window.

You can select the blue line with your mouse to pull or reduce it. You can edit the image to fit the area.

If the image is large, simply drag the area with the mouse to apply the desired image.

**\* If you upload an image smaller than the size you need to upload, you may need to increase the size of the original image, which may result in poor image resolution.**

(This happens when the uploaded image size is smaller than the image size above 1024×1024).

Therefore, **we recommend that you use an image that is larger than the specified size!!**

When you finished editing the image, click on the \[Uploaded] button**.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/이미지편집도구2.png)

The image size has been modified.&#x20;

check the uploaded image in the file attachment window and select the \[Apply] button.

This way you can modify image size in the swing2app image editor tool.

<mark style="color:red;">**Editing Tool Precautions**</mark>



1\)We recommend you to upload images as per recommended size guide provided by us.

Although the swing2app image editor tool is good for resizing the image but since the icons and splash screens are large images with a resolution that is immediately visible when installing a mobile phone app, it is much better in terms of quality to register the finished image than to artificially modify the size.



2\)The image editing tool **only provides the ability to resize the image.**

It does not offer picture editing functions such as Photoshop, Illustration, and Paint. Therefore, please upload a final image after editing it in some proper editing software.&#x20;



3\)If you upload an image that is smaller than the recommended image size, the image resolution will have a bad impact when you'll resize it.

Therefore, we recommend that you use images that are larger than the specified size.
