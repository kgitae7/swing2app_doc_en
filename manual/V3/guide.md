**\[STEP2 Prototype]** is the step of determining the overall design and style of the app's UI design and color.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/가이드2.png)

\*Swing2App offers a total of 7 prototype designs.

**2. Basic styles and options**

Select Color Set: Sets the app and color of the UI design.

It offers a color combination consisting of 3 sets which are the main background colors, text colors, and theme colors.

Once you have selected the desired combination, you can see the UI changing colors in real-time through the virtual machine.

**3. Advanced styles and options**

This feature allows you to set additional color options and design styles that you can add to the prototype UI.

This is not a required setting, users can modify if they want to.

**4. Custom settings**

**​**

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;"><mark style="color:red;">What if none of the combined colors present in the preset are not as per your interest? In that case,  please use the detailed settings.<mark style="color:red;"></mark>
{% endhint %}

If the desired color is not present, the user can select the color directly in \[Detailed Settings].

In addition to the fixed color combinations, the detailed color setting is an option that allows the user to select and apply their own colors.
