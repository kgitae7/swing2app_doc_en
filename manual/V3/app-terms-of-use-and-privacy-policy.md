# App Terms of Use And Privacy Policy

**What is the Privacy Policy? What are its Terms of Use?**

These are the terms and conditions that mention what information we collect from users of the app (personal information) and what mandatory usage policies are for the app.

This is a mandatory setting and must be entered into the mobile app.

﻿

This information consists of, what data is collected from the app users, for what purpose we need their data, the period of use of personal information, the person in charge of personal information protection (person in charge), etc, must be provided to the user in accordance with the Information and Communications Network Act.

Because a swing2app app is created by the user as a developer thus, these policies must also be put into the app by the user.&#x20;

Users should modify and set the Terms of Use as per their App Service.

Swing2App provides the ability to <mark style="color:red;">write the terms of use and privacy policy on the app subscription policy page so that users can edit and write the contents themselves.</mark>

**Where and how do the App Terms of Use and Privacy Policy look like?**

![](broken-reference)

**1)Go to the manager page – select \[Check the subscription settings] and you can check the contents.**

The feature is present by default when the app is created, so the user doesn't need to create it from scratch.

You can change the terms of use and the contents of the Privacy Policy of your app as per requirement.



2\)When you release your app to the Play Store or the App Store, you have to also include the privacy policy URL in the release information field.

Because it is a mandatory registration, those who release apps to the Store must also complete and submit the applicable terms.

Swing2app is not responsible for problems caused by not entering content or problems caused by entering content that is different from your app service.

Therefore, please check it carefully and modify it.

Since the Terms and Conditions provide all the information about personal information, please modify and apply it with the Terms of Service to complete the Privacy Policy.

4\) The default terms and conditions provided by the Swing2App are the services provided to users who create apps with Swing2App\~!

We are receiving more and more reports of people who don't build an app with a swing2app but only take the URL of the terms and conditions and use it as a link to the privacy policy for their app.

**Kindly do not use our default policy for your app! If you do so, It will be considered an unauthorized theft of the program.**

**Therefore, those who continuously use our unique Usage Policy URL will report it to Google for action.**

If you receive this report on Google, it can result in the deletion of your app.&#x20;
