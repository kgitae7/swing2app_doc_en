# Page Design - View Coupons Page

**What is the Coupon View menu?**

**Viewing coupons is a coupon lookup page for users where you can view coupons issued by the app and see which coupons have been used.**

When an administrator issues a coupon to a user, the user needs a page where they can see the list of coupons they have received.

The View Coupons menu allows users to see a list of coupons they have received and a list of coupons that have been redeemed.

So if you're running a coupon-issuing app, you'll have to apply that menu in the app's creation, right?

This function is available on page **MakerV3 screen-> STEP3 → Basic Feature→ View coupon page.**

I'll show you how to apply the coupon lookup menu to the app and use it\~!

**Find out how to create and apply coupons!**

The coupon must be registered by the administrator by first creating a coupon for use in the app in the manager screen, and then moving on to the app makerv3 to apply the coupon lookup page to the app.

And in the manager screen of the app, the administrator can issue coupons to the user and process the usage.

**STEP.1 Create a coupon**

Manager page → Services → Coupon → Enter the coupon details to be issued by selecting the \[Add Coupon] button.

**STEP.2 Issuing coupons**

From the coupon management page → select the \[Send Coupon] button → 1) Select the recipient settings → 2) Select the member you want to send push → 3) Select \[Send Coupon] → 4) Push message Subject → 5) Push Message Content → 6) Register Image → 7) Select \[Send Coupon].​

**STEP.3 Processing coupon redemption**

On the Coupon Management page, select 1) \[Use Coupon] button → 2) Enter Coupon Serial Number → 3) \[View and Use Coupon].

Alternatively, you can select the App Manager menu in the app to process coupon redemption.
