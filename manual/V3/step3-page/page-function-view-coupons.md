# Page Design - View Coupons Page

**What is the Coupon View menu?**

**Viewing coupons is a coupon lookup page for users where you can view coupons issued by the app and see which coupons have been used.**

When an administrator issues a coupon to a user, the user needs a page where they can see the list of coupons they have received.

The View Coupons menu allows users to see a list of coupons they have received and a list of coupons that have been redeemed.

So if you're running a coupon-issuing app, you'll have to apply that menu in the app's creation, right?

This function is available on page **STEP3 → the app creation → page basic functions.**

I'll show you how to apply the coupon lookup menu to the app and use it\~!

**Find out how to create and apply coupons!**

The coupon must be registered by the administrator by first creating a coupon for use in the app in the app operation, and then moving on to the app creation to apply the coupon lookup page to the app.

And in the operation of the app, the administrator can issue coupons to the user and process the usage.
