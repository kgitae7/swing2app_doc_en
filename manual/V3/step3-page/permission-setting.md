# Set menu settings: Access permissions

***

**What is an access permission setting?**

With the ability to set permissions to access in-app menus, you can set user-specific permissions to view the menu, such as making it accessible only to specific members and registered users.

If the menu that can be viewed by permission needs to be different depending on the nature of the app, the administrator can set the access permissions for each menu directly.

The Access Permission feature was only available on the bulletin board, but in the V3 update, it was added to apply to all menus.

The menu permission function is exclusively available on the Maker V3 version (not available in the MakerV2 version).

So, if you wish to use this feature, you can switch to the MakerV3 version easily. Be sure to proceed with the initial update at the time of the transition from MakerV2 to MakerV3.
