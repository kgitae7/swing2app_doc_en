It is a web page creation tool provided by the user page- it is a design template creation tool for each industry.&#x20;

Users can create a web page by inputting only text and images according to the guidelines on the page where the design is applied.

Users can create pages more easily by providing templates for each style and industry for web pages that are difficult to create directly in terms of design.&#x20;
