# Page Design - Attendance Check Page

**What is an attendance check?**

**It's a menu that can be used as a community and event, similar to a bulletin board, but with differences in that it has an attendance comment function and a closing function!**

Therefore, the attendance check is available from the service management menu and not from the bulletin board.

Various attendance check events can engage app members.

Check the manual to find out how to apply the attendance check page to the app.
