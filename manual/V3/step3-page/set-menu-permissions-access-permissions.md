# Set menu permissions: Access permissions

***

**What is an access permission setting?**

With the ability to set permissions to access in-app menus, you can set user-specific permissions to view the menu, such as making it accessible only to specific members and registered users.

If the menu that can be viewed by permission needs to be different depending on the nature of the app, the administrator can set the accessible permissions for each menu directly.

The Access Rights feature was only available on the bulletin board, but in the V3 update it was added to apply to all menus.

The menu disable function is an addition to the V3 version and is not available in the V2 version.

If you use this feature, you can switch to the V3 version. Be sure to proceed with the initial update at the time of the transition.

The permission setting feature can be applied in the Step of the App Authoring – STEP3 page.

Through the manual, we will show you how to apply each access right to the menu and the app launch screen.

Members can see which groups you have created as ratings.

If you are selecting a group of 2nd or 1st grade, please select it from the appropriate tabs.

\*Before selecting a membership group, a permission group must be created first.

If you have selected the Assigned Permissions only for Level 2 members, this is the app launch screen.
