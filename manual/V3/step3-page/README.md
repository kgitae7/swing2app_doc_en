The Home screen is the main screen that is visible when you launch the app, and you can configure how the main screen will be displayed by the user themselves.

Menus provided by the Swing-to-App – You can apply menus such as weblinks, swing pages, user pages, bulletin boards, images, and more.

In this guide, we'll apply industry-specific templates.

After typing, click the cursor once or press the Enter button to reflect it directly to the virtual machine.

\*Since you don't have any pages created, you must first go to the Page Template Creator to create a template page.
