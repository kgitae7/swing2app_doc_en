Websites are sometimes set up to prevent web links from being retrieved from the outside because of the security of each site.

Sites that are prohibited from embedding may result in an app refusing to connect or causing an error when you enter a link.

**☞ An optional feature that comes up to solve this problem is 'Open in a new window'.**

**It's not a style of opening links within the app, it's about popping up a new window in the app so that the site can open without problems!!**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled-2-ReSDGed.png)

The same goes for opening it as a new app. What makes it different from the view in a new window is the structure in which the app is launched and the link is opened.

**There are links that run the app. For example, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Kakao, etc.**

This will generate a link address, but for web addresses that are opened using the original app, please select "Open as a new app"

**\*Important\*** When linking YouTube videos and channel links, you must select 'Open as external app'. \_ Google Policy Content

**Therefore, when using a web link, be sure to check 'popup' in a new window.**

**Even websites that are not secured should be selected to view in a new window so that you can use them more reliably in the app.**

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**\*Link function important guide**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**\*\*\*\***</mark>

1.The link function cannot be applied to the home screen (HOME menu).

**Please apply the link function to menus only**.

The home screen is **not recommended because the web link 'View in a new window' does not apply.**

It won't open in a new window, so as we mentioned earlier, we can't fix it if you have security at stake.

If a security program such as payment is activated, it will not be able to be used normally within the app.

So make sure you don't use a web link on your home screen!

In in-app categories except for the home screen, you can launch view as a new window or view as an external app.

2.Even if you apply other web links, there are links that do not apply normally to the menu, or that the site connection is not successful.

**1) Shared web link provided by Google Drive with only certain permissions available**

**2) Web links that are only available within a specific company (links with external web server shield)**

**3)Privacy websites that prohibit other external embeddings**

These sites will not work properly if you link to the app if you get an error or if you see it.

Please refer to the usage.
