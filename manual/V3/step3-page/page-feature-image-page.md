# Page Design - Image Page

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line">**What is an image page?**

Image page is a custom editor tool that you can use to create an image for your app.

You can edit an image by applying a link and tooltip to it.

The ability to apply a variety of links to images can be useful when building apps.

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line">**Utilization Tip**&#x20;



1. When multiple web links need to be applied to one image ex) Applicable to multiple links instead of one, such as homepage and blog.
2. When applying multiple bulletin board links to one image ex) Bulletin board links such as notice boards and free bulletin boards can be applied.
3. If you want to put a more detailed description of the image, you can apply the tooltip so that the message appears.
4. Can work on a banner – Create an image in banner style and specify the area to apply the link.

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line"> **If you want to put an image full on your home screen when creating an image page, you can work with the mobile screen resolution standard of 1080px horizontally and 1980-2200px vertically.**

**★To fit the horizontal size, the vertical length is adjusted according to the screen of the phone.**

**So depending on what prototype you applied to the portrait and the type of phone you have, it may be a little longer or shorter in length.**

Because it is fixed horizontally and vertically changes depending on the mobile environment, not all phones can show the same screen.

**Please refer to it when using it\~**

### ![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png) **STEP 2.** Creating an Image Page

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%802.18.09.png)

In this editor tool screen, you can easily create an image page.

**1.Register an image**

Be the first to register your image.

**Select the \[Upload Image] button or the \[New] button to select the image you want to register.**

\*Since the image page is a function to put a banner such as a link on top of the designed image, you need to upload it as a finished image!

{% hint style="success" %}
If this is the first time you are working, please select the \[New] button to do the work.

If you need to re-upload a modified image in addition to what you have already done, you may want to use the \[Upload Image] button!
{% endhint %}

***

**2. Modify the image page**

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%804.18.09.png)

Modification process of the image page:

**All you need to do is check the 'Shape Tool' which sets the banner area on top of the image, the 'Link Action' which allows you to link to the area, and the 'Default Style' which sets the area style.**

{% hint style="success" %}
★Default style

\-Background Color: You can color the area you set with the tool.

\-Background Opacity: You can specify the transparency of the area set by the tool.

If you don't want the tool to be visible when you select the mouse, you can set the transparency to '0'\*\*.\*\*
{% endhint %}

***

**3. Shape Tools – Check your style**

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%805.18.09.png)

**Tool shapes are available in dot shapes, squares, ellipses, and polygons.**

\- When using a dot shape, clicking the mouse cursor over the image creates a point.

\-When using a rectangular or oval shape, simply place the mouse cursor over the image and drag it from the left to create an area.

\- For polygons, dotting multiple areas, and then dotting back to where you originally dotted creates a polygon area.

**▶ Please check how to set the area through the image that you are receiving.**

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EC%95%B1%EC%A0%9C%EC%9E%91%EB%8F%84%EA%B5%AC.gif)

***

**4. Apply the link**

Once you've set up a shape, let's see how to apply a link inside the shape zone you set.

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%806.18.09.png)

**For links, please select the \[Link Action] option provided on the right side settings screen.**

**1) Mouse hover:** This is a menu that applies how it works when you touch the mouse.

Select \[Do nothing] because you will only apply the \[View: Do Nothing, Show Tooltips] link.

**2) Click Action:** This is a menu that applies how it works when the mouse is clicked.

Select \[Move Link] because you need to go to the link when selecting \[View: Do Nothing, Show Tooltip, Move Link].

**3) Link Wizard:** A tool that allows you to select the app menu, web link, etc. page to be linked.

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%808.18.09.png)

When you select the Link Wizard button, the 'Link Wizard' window will pop up as shown in the image above.

Here, when you have selected the banner, you can select the menu you want to move.

In the manual, we chose the introductory banner for the image, so we'll choose the 'Introduction to Swing Cafe' template that we've worked on beforehand.

You can select \[Reflect].

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**\*Precautions**</mark>

The menus and content within the app need to be completed.

If you don't have a bulletin board or user page at all, you won't have a menu to choose from in the Link Wizard, right?

So, when you're done creating all the content that will go into your app, use the Link Wizard on the Images page.
{% endhint %}

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%809.18.09.png)

Of course\~ in the Link Wizard, you can apply it to all other menus in addition to the above menus.

For example, **if you select a banner and you want it to go to your blog, you can select \[Link Wizard] and then in \[Weblink] – enter the blog site address URL and reflect it**

Let me give you a TIP.

If you use the **\*\*\[Duplicate Style button]\*\* in the list, you can get the same area style and the default style as is.**

All you have to do is change the link settings, which makes it a little easier!

**5. Complete Production**

The image page has been applied

Finally, please enter the page name. (When applied to the app, the page name will appear in the menu.)
