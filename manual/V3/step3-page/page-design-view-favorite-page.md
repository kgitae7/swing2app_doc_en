**View Posts – A bookmark feature that brings together all the posts you 'liked' a post.**

**It's a feature that brings together and shows all the posts that the user has pressed the 'like' button on the app post.**

It's a common bookmarking feature.

If any of your posts are from what you want to see again later, or if you want to save them, just press the 'Like' button.

You can see it all in the Watchlist view
