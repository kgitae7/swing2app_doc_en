**Page design provided by the page step - A swing page is a menu that provides the essential functionality of the app provided by the Swing-to-App app.**

Sign up, sign in, and set up are some of the most common app features.

In addition to these functions, you can select a variety of functions from the swing page and apply them to your app.

We'll show you how to apply the sign-up, login, and settings pages provided by the swing page to the app and the app launch screen.

The app launch screen with the settings feature applied.

Settings include both registration and login.

So it's okay not to use the sign-up or login functions, just apply the settings to the app.

In addition to these features\*notifications, we also provide notification-push settings, notification list checking, app sharing, app version check, admin login, and app shutdown.

Therefore, when creating an app, we recommend that you apply the setting function to the app and create it!

Administrator login is a feature that allows you to log in as an administrator and operate in the app.

You can check the details of how to use the function by checking the manual link below.

**\*Important Information**

1\)Membership registration, login, and settings provided on the swing page are not applicable to the home screen.

It is only applicable to app menus (categories), so please use it only as a menu.

2\) It is recommended that you apply one function of 'login' rather than using membership and login together.

Or use the 'Settings' menu that comes with the registration and login menu.

3\) The membership registration form can be modified in the <mark style="color:blue;">http://www.swing2app.co.kr/view/app\_policy</mark> of the \[Registration Form Settings] page, and when the ID form is modified, it is reflected on the login screen.

4\)Since the settings page is provided with a fixed content UX, the item cannot be modified like registering.

Available only on the pages provided.

5\) All the features (pages) provided on the swing page are only provided with a fixed design, so style modification is not possible.

Depending on the prototype color change, the background color, etc., can be modified, but the design cannot be changed.
