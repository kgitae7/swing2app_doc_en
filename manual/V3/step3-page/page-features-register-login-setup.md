The app launch screen with the settings features applied.

Settings include both Signup and Login options.

So it's okay not to use the sign-up or log-in functions in the menu, just apply the settings to the app.

In addition to these features, we also provide **push-notification settings, notification list checking, app sharing, app version check, and admin login.**

Therefore, when creating an app, we recommend that you apply the setting function to the app and create it!

Administrator login is a feature that allows you to log in as an administrator and operate the app.

You can check the details of how to use the function by checking the manual link below.

**\*Important Information**

1\)Membership signup, login, and settings provided on the swing page are not applicable to the home screen.

It is only applicable to app menus (categories), so please use it only as a menu.

2\) It is recommended that you apply one function of 'login' rather than using membership and login together.

Or use the 'Settings' menu that comes with the registration and login menu.

3\) The membership registration form can be modified on the [<mark style="color:blue;">http://www.swing2app.co.kr/view/app\_policy</mark>](https://www.swing2app.com/view/app_policy) of the \[Subscription Settings] page, and when the ID form is modified, it is reflected on the login screen.

4\)Since the settings page is provided with a fixed content UX, the item cannot be modified like registering.

Available only on the pages provided.

5\) All the features (pages) provided on the swing page are only provided with a fixed design, so style modification is not possible.

Depending on the prototype color change, the background color, etc., can be modified, but the design cannot be changed.
