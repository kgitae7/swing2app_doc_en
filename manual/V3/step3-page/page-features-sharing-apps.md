App sharing is also available in the settings menu set by default within the app without having to use the app sharing function on the swing page.

After launching the app, you can use the Share App function in the → Settings menu.

Settings is a page where you can set app basics, set notifications, and sign up, and the settings menu is created as the default settings when you create an app.

Therefore, you can also use the app sharing function as a basic function in the settings menu.

**And in addition to sharing apps, you can also share bulletin boards, posts, and images.**
