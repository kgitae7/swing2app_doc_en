# Page Design - App Introduction Page

**What is an app introduction?**

**The app introduction is a home screen style page provided by the swing page and is one of the menus that fills up the main home screen.**

It can show you the app introduction, site address (URL), address, phone number, and email address, making it the most basic home screen configuration design.

&#x20;When you first build your app with Swing2App, If you are not sure about what to put on the home screen, go with the app introduction page which has a default setting to show users the home screen guidelines.

In addition to the app introduction page, you can freely change and create various other menus – image pages, web templates, HTML editor pages, images, bulletin boards, web links, etc.

\*Since the app introduction is the default sample page, we recommend that you change it to another menu.

**Go to the HomeScreen editing Manual:** <mark style="color:blue;">https://wp. swing2app. co.kr/ documentation/ v3manual/home/</mark> &#x20;

**This is the screen where the app introduction page is applied.**

**Representative of the app icon image, the style is that the app introduction, the website link (URL) at the bottom, and the navigation buttons at the bottom are placed.**

The app introduction is the home main screen that we provide by default to those who are creating apps with a Swing2App for the first time.

Therefore, you do not have to apply the home screen as an 'Introduction to the App' and use it.

You can modify your home screen with a variety of different menus to create.

**▶ Please check the page you are moving to when selecting the App Introduction-Icon banner through the image that you are in.**

\*\*\*\*

**1)If I modify the introductory text of the app and save it, will it not be reflected immediately?**

App Introduction Title Phrase Modification will be reflected only if you save it on the first 1 modification and then press the \[App Creation] button to update it to the new version.

After 1 modification, just save it and it will be automatically reflected in the app from then on.

**2)When entering the site address, it is linked with the \[Share] icon button at the bottom and the site link address in the middle.**

Therefore, if you enter the site address, the sharing button and the site address will be displayed together.

If you delete it, it will be removed along with the share button and the site address.

**3) The representative image of the app introduction page is displayed in conjunction with the app icon image. \*Separate modification and removal are not possible.**

**4) When the first app was created, the home screen set the main screen to the 'About App' page.**

It's a guideline-setting screen for first-time creators.

Therefore, in addition to the app introduction page, the home screen can be modified with various menus.
