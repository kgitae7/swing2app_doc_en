However, if you want to make the phone screen more or less full, please work with \*Horizontal Size: 1080px and Portrait 1980px to 2200px.

\-Portrait varies depending on the mobile phone model, so please adjust the size a little bit by looking at the vertical app screen.

\- Since it is resized to the mobile screen in line with the horizontal screen, the vertical length can be a little bit or longer for each phone, resulting in scrolling.

The app introduction page is the home screen that becomes the default setting as the home screen when you first build your app in a swing-to-app app.

**Instructions for applying the home screen**

****

**1) Home Screen – Applying a web link is not recommended.**

\-When you put a website on the home screen, the new screen may not open and end abnormally, or the site may not open in the app due to the security settings within the site.

\- For webpages that need to be opened in a new window, they can look foreign on the app screen. (Screen configuration of pop-up windows, etc.)

Therefore, please use only the menus mentioned above on the home screen.

\*\*Also!! There's a site that prohibits embedding when applying web links.

\*Naver, the following portal sites, and the sites provided by the portal, YouTube, social media sites (Instagram, **** Facebook), etc. are the representative sites that have been banned from embedding!

In particular, the Naver blog or the next café that you run may not be able to connect properly to your home because it is blocked by Naver and the next itself.

In general, shopping mall sites may also not be applicable inside the app due to a secure server such as payment.

\* Apps applied to websites with such external security should not be released on the Play Store or App Store.

\*If the web link is linked to the app menu and checked in 'View in a new window', it can be used without problems.



**2) For those who want to build an app by walking through a website – we recommend that you build it as a webview app or a push app.**

It is a style that is created by linking the web browser to the app as it is in the form of a web app.

If you set up a link to the site on the main home screen of the app, events such as going back will not work properly because they behave differently from the website's page history.

Especially for shopping mall sites, the same security behavior as the purchase will not work properly when applied to a regular prototype app.

So if you want to use your website as your main one, you can create it by applying it as 'WebView' or 'Push' in Design Theme - Prototype.



**3) The home screen can be freely decorated using the menus.**

You can apply an image page, apply a template page, and then freely change to another menu.

If you just press Save, it will be automatically reflected in the app as well, so you don't need to update it separately.



**4) The home screen has the main screen set to the 'About the App' page.**

It's a guideline setting screen for first-time creators.

Therefore, in addition to the app introduction page, we recommend that you change the home screen to another menu and use it.

Above, I told you how to create a home screen.

There are a lot of different menus that make up the home screen, so try to decorate your home screen in different styles\~!

We recommend that you modify it to other menus in addition to the default set of app introduction menus.

**\*Users who create in the style of push, webview are created by applying the website link to the app, so they don't have to create a home screen separately. ^^**
