1\. Apply an image

2\. Apply bulletin board

3\. User Page - Image Page

4\. User Page - Web Template

5\. User Page – HTML Editor Page

6\. App Introduction Page

**\*Please do not apply web links (websites) to your home screen. If you wish to connect the website with the home screen then please create it in a webview or a push-only prototype and not in a regular prototype.**

**Home screen creation can be created by selecting the HOME button → the HOME screen setting → the STEP3 page → the App Maker Maker.**

You can create a screen by choosing from the different features that come with the page design.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/홈제작1-1.png)

1\)Go to the STEP3 Page option

2\)Click and select \[HOME] menu

3\)Enter the menu name: Enter the name that will be visible at the top of the home.&#x20;

\*If you don't rename it, it will appear as the app name.

4\) From the page design, go to the \[Upload Image] option and Click on the \[Image Upload] button.

5\)When the Attach File window appears, select the image file you want.

6\)Click on the \[Apply] button

7\)Click on the \[Save] button at the top of the screen and you're done!

{% hint style="info" %}
\*The images are different in size than the size of the cellphone, so there is no exact recommended size.

However, if you want to make the phone screen more or less full, please work with \*Horizontal Size: 1080px and Portrait 1980px to 2200px.

\-Portrait varies depending on the mobile phone model, so please adjust the size a little bit by looking at the vertical app screen.

\- Since it is resized to the mobile screen in line with the horizontal screen, the vertical length can be a little bit longer for each phone, resulting in scrolling.
{% endhint %}

\*Note: Writing is not provided when applying the bulletin board to the home screen.

This means that the home screen only provides a detailed article view of the list of bulletin boards, and you cannot write posts on the bulletin board applied to the home screen.

The app introduction page is the home screen that is the default setting as the home screen when you first build your app in a swing2app app.

Therefore, users can use the app introduction page as it is, and they can change the home screen in various styles according to the above method\~!

If you use the home screen in a different style and then apply the home screen back to the app introduction page, please apply it in the following way.

**Instructions for applying the home screen**



**1) Home Screen – Applying a web link is not recommended.**

\-When you link a website on the home screen, the new screen may not open and might show an error, or the site may not open in the app due to the security settings within the site.

\- For webpages that need to be opened in a new window, they can look weird on the app screen. (Screen configuration of pop-up windows, etc.)

Therefore, please use only the menus mentioned above on the home screen.

\*\*Also!! There's a site that prohibits embedding when applying web links.

\*Naver, the following portal sites, and the sites provided by the portal, YouTube, social media sites (Instagram, Facebook), etc. are the representative sites that have been banned from embedding!

In particular, the Naver blog or the next café that you run may not be able to connect properly to your home because it is blocked by Naver and the next itself.

In general, shopping mall sites may also not be applicable inside the app due to a secure server such as payment.

\* Apps applied to websites with such external security should not be released on the Play Store or App Store.

\*If the web link is linked to the app menu and checked in 'View in a new window', it can be used without problems.



**2) For those who want to build an app by linking through a website – we recommend that you build it as a webview app or a push-only app.**

It is a style that is created by linking the web browser to the app as it is in the form of a web app.

If you set up a link to the site on the main home screen of the app, events such as going back will not work properly because they behave differently from the website's page history.

Especially for shopping mall sites, the same security behavior as the purchase will not work properly when applied to a regular prototype app.

So if you want to use your website as your main one, you can create it by applying it as 'WebView' or 'Push-Only' in Design Theme - Prototype.



**3) The home screen can be freely modified by using the menus.**

You can apply an image page, or a template page, and then freely change to another menu.

If you just click on the \[Save] button, it will be automatically reflected in the app as well, so you don't need to update it separately.



**4) The home screen has the main screen set to the 'About the App' page.**

It's a guideline-setting screen for first-time creators.

Therefore, in addition to the app introduction page, we recommend that you change the home screen to another menu and use it.

Above, I told you how to create a home screen.

There are a lot of different menus that you can make as home screens, so try to modify your home screen in different styles\~!

We recommend that you modify it to other menus in addition to the default set of app introduction menus.

**\*Users who create in the style of push-only, and webview are created by applying the website link to the app, so they don't have to create a home screen separately. ^^**
