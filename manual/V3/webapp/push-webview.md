# How to create a push app or  webview app easily

**If you have a website, you can convert it into an app by linking the website URL link to the app.**

If you use the 'push' or 'webview' UI style of the prototypes provided by the Swing2App, you can create a mobile app in just 5 minutes.

**You can convert your website into an app, exactly the same. In the App Creation Wizard, you only need to complete the 3-step process to see the web app with the website working together.**

**We'll show you how to build a push-only app and webview app.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is a push app?**

**For 'push' only, just enter the URL of the user's homepage without any other creation functions, and the app will be created by integrating the website into the app as it is.**

**With push notifications available,** you can send events, ads, and promotional messages to your users. ****&#x20;
{% endhint %}

When you create a new app or add an app, the App Creation Wizard pop-up window will appear first on the dashboard screen.

Simply enter the step-by-step information in the App Creation Wizard to create a push-only app!

****

**1)Website address**

This is the site link you want to apply to your app, and be sure to include a hyperlink http://.

After entering the link address, a single click on the mouse cursor in the empty space will be reflected.

You can check if the applied site is popping up well with the preview window (virtual machine) on the right.

**2) Check whether the push function is enabled**

Push is a feature that allows you to send push notifications to your app users who have installed the app to send announcements, and promotional reminders from the app, via Swing2App.

**Since we will be creating it as a push app, please check 'Yes' for the Push notifications option.**

**3)Using the toolbar**

If you check whether to use the toolbar or not, the toolbar will be visible at the bottom of the app screen, and if you check 'No, the toolbar area will not be visible in the app.

So make sure you set it to match your app's style. Check the default setting as 'yes'.

**4)Select the \[Next] button.**

\-Website address, push function, and toolbar function can be modified again in the App maker.



**3.Register the app name, icon, and splash screen image.**

### ![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png)WebViewApp Features

\-When creating an app with a webview, you can create an app by simply including the web link URL address.

\-Since the website is displayed within the app in the same style as it is, you cannot use other app menus provided by the Swing2App. (Push function is not available)

\-If you want to send push notifications, you need to select Prototype: Push Only.

\-However, you can send push notifications in Webview too but not via Swing2App; you'll have to use OneSignal integration for sending push notifications in the webview app.



### ![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png) **** How do I change the weblink address after creating the webview app?

The same goes for changing the weblink address applied to your app.

**Page Menu – 1)Select \[Homescreen] Button → 2)Menu Type: Select Web Link → 3)Enter the URL Address in the WebLink → 4)Apply Button → 5)Select Save Button**

\*Modifying the web link address is automatically reflected in the app by simply pressing the Save button.

\*If you exit the app and relaunch it, it will be applied to the changed website.

\*Important\* Apps that use the WebView Unlimited plugin product will not be able to change the web link address.

The details are listed on the Payment and Details page, and we will guide you, so please refer to it!

It can be changed during the general subscription.

The WebView prototype also converts mobile websites into a webview app by linking the URL, and the app is exactly the same as the website.

Unlike the push version, you can't send a "push notification" because it's an app prototype that doesn't use other app features and is only created by clicking a link to a website.

As you can see in the image, the mobile web and the webview app you create are the same without any difference.

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/%EC%9B%B9%EB%B7%B05.png)

When creating a webview app or push app, after entering the website address, you can see that the preview window (virtual machine) displays the message "Please check after installing the app on your mobile phone" or "Refused to connect".

**If the security that prevents external connections within the website you connected to, that is, the prohibition of external sharing and embedding, is enabled, you will see the message.**

Therefore, when you link to a website that has this security setting, you will see a message that says Deny Connection on the web preview screen.

Even if you get these messages, it **doesn't mean you can't build an app.**

**You can check more accurately by simply checking with the app that the screen cannot be displayed on the web for security reasons.**

**Therefore, please save and \[Create App] and download it to the app to confirm.**

If you look at it as an app, you can see that the site works normally with the app.

If the app also refuses to connect, please contact the Swing2App Help.

\*However, the URL for internal use and the site address used by the company's internal server cannot be connected and cannot be created as a web app.

To learn how to download (install) your app, please check the manual below.

### ![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/%EB%8B%A8%EB%9D%BD1-1.png) **** Please be careful when creating push and webview apps.

**1) There is a web link that does not work with the app, that is, there is a site that prohibits embedding.**

\*Naver, the following portal sites, and the sites provided by the portal (modoo, storefarm web, etc.), YouTube, social media sites (Instagram, KakaoTalk, Facebook), etc. are the representative sites that have been banned from embedding!

Therefore, you **need to apply a homepage that can prove that you created it with domain registration information, and a website (homepage) that can be verified by a business registration certificate if it is created by the company.**

There are many users who want to link their Naver blog or the next café with a webview or push.

These sites will error or will not function properly if you link them to the app.

**\* These apps should not be released on the Play Store or the App Store.**

Therefore, please do not apply the above links to webview apps, push-only apps.

It's okay to put that link in an external menu from another prototype, but make sure that the app link itself doesn't use the above site address.

**2) Do not change from a push-version or webview-version prototype to another prototype.**

After being built as a webview-based (push, webview) prototype, → cannot be changed to a generic prototype (slide, Top, Down, Drop list and Drop box)

\*If you need to change from a webview-based prototype to a different prototype, you'll need to create a new app.

**3) If your goal is to commercialize the app (launch the store), please use the paid version.**

**Push or webview apps also need to be purchased and used as a paid version of the Swing Paid App in order to launch the app on the Play Store or App Store.**

**TIP. If you launch the store with a webview or a push app, you can purchase an unlimited subscription and you will have unlimited access to the app for a fee with no limit on the duration of the service.**

<mark style="color:blue;">**☞**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:blue;">**Go to WebView Unlimited Paid App Products**</mark>

[**☞** ](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/documentation/appmanage/pay/push-unlimited/)<mark style="color:blue;">**Go to Push Unlimited Paid App Products**</mark>



**4) The web link (site URL) applied when using the push app and the webview app can be changed while using it. (No need to create an app, just press Save to automatically reflect)**

It's the same as building the first app.

In the menu step of the → page of the app creation page, you can modify the URL in the website address field → the → HOME button and save it.

Exit and relaunch the app and it will be applied to the changed website.

\*However, users of Push Unlimited Paid App Subscription will need to save and re-create the app. You will need to update to the new version to be reflected.
