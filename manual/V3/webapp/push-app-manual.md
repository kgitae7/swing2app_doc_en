**App Maker V3 Version – How to Create a Push App Manual**



> **What is a push app?**
>
> Push App is a web app production platform created by attatching a link to a mobile web URL such as a homepage.
>
> Because the website works within the app as it is, you can create the same app as the web.
>
> Unlike a webview app, the biggest feature of a push app is that it allows you to send push notifications to users who have installed the app via Swing2App platform!

> ## **Start.** Get started with the App Creation Wizard

When you first create an app in a Swing2App or build additional apps, the App Creation Wizard splash screen (a pop-up window) pops up first.

Here, you choose what type of app you want to build, then enter the basic information and you'll be taken to the App maker.

**​**

<mark style="color:blue;">**1.App Creation process: Select a web app based on the website**</mark>

![](https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/%EC%9B%B9%EB%B7%B00.png)

For push apps, please select the 2nd method of creation, "Web App Based on Website".

This is a style that creates a website by applying it to the app as it is.

Select the \[Next] button.

<mark style="color:blue;">**2.Enter web app basic information**</mark>

The next step is to enter the basic information, where you enter the basics needed to build a web app.

![](broken-reference)

**1) Enter the website address (URL).**

This is the site link you want to apply to your app, and be sure to include a complete hyperlink.

After entering the link address, a single click on the mouse cursor in the empty space will be reflected.

You can check if the applied site is popping up well with the preview window (virtual machine) screen on the right.

**2) Check whether the push function is enabled**

Push is a feature that allows you to send push notifications to your users via Swing2Appp who have installed your app to send information about announcements, and promotional reminders from the app.

**Since we will be making it a push app, please check the use of the push option as 'Yes'.**

If you check whether to use the toolbar or not, the toolbar will be visible at the bottom of the app screen, and if you check 'No', the toolbar area will not be visible in the app.

So make sure you set it to match your app's style.

Select the \[Next] button.

​

<mark style="color:blue;">**3.Enter app name, icon, standby screen image**</mark>

![](broken-reference)

The final step is to **register the app name input, app icon, and standby image.**

App names, icons, and splash screen images can all be modified again in the App maker.

If the image isn't ready yet, you can just enter the app name and press the Submit button.

Icons and images that will fit on the splash screen can be reapplied in the App maker.

​

<mark style="color:green;">**–> How to upload icon and splash screen image**</mark>

![](broken-reference)

On the app icon and the splash screen, select the \[Register] button and the file attachment window will open.

You can upload an image here and apply it.

\- Icon image size: **1024px\*1024px**

\-Standby screen image size: **2282px\*2282px**

When the image upload is complete, select the \[Apply] button.

When the App Creation Wizard registration is complete, the App Maker screen opens.

If you look at the app creation process on the left, you can see the steps on the STEP1 Basic Information, STEP2 Design, and STEP3 Page.

Step by step, enter your content and you're done.

**\*When the STEP progress reaches 100%, it means all step inputs are complete.**

**​**

## **STEP1** Basic Information



![](broken-reference)

**STEP1 The contents in the basic information have already been registered in the App Creation Wizard except for the app ID.**

If you modify the app name, you can re-enter it.

If you modify the app icon, splash screen image, or register a new one, you can complete the registration on that screen.

1\) Enter App ID <mark style="color:red;">**\*The app ID is the unique identifier of the app and cannot be changed after setting.**</mark>

2\) Enter the app name

3\) App icon image **(1024px\*1024px)**

4\) App standby image registration **(2282px\*2282px)**

5\) Select \[Save] button

**​**

**\*App icon image, splash screen image: Please create an image according to the size listed on the screen first, and then register.**

**For icons and splash screens, please first look at the Production Guidelines Manual and create them!**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Go to the icon image creation guide**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Go to the splash screen image creation guide**</mark>

**\*App name, icon, and splash screen images, except for the app ID, can be modified and updated without limitation.**

**When modifying the app basic information, you need to press the \[App Update] button to update to the new version**.

**​**

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Information**</mark>

If you modify the STEP1 Basic Information menu again after the app is created, you will need to update the app again before the app will reflect the changes.

For example, if you changed the name of your app, save → after the change → press the Update App button to recreate it as a new version.

If it's released on the App Store or Play Store, you'll need to resubmit updates to that Store as an updated version of the app.

The STEP3 page step will enter a link to the website that applies to your app, which you have already registered in the App Creation Wizard.

If you want to edit the site address, please re-enter it in the appropriate step. If you don't have anything to modify, just save it.

1\)Enter your website address

2\) Address setting: Choose whether to set the first run address

\*First Run Address Line In addition to the website associated with the app, when users install the app that separate web page is only visible the first time.

Check 'No' if you don't use it, or 'Yes' if you don't use it. Please include a complete Hyperlink when entering your site address.

3\)Select the Save button

​

<mark style="color:red;">**\*Information**</mark>

The STEP3 page menu is automatically reflected in the app by simply modifying and saving it. You don't need to update the app (recreate the app).



\
**STEP4 Complete App Creation**
-------------------------------

![](broken-reference)

​All steps have been entered. You can build apps.

1\)Select the Create App button

2\) Select the \[App Creation] button in the App Creation pop-up window.

The Show Updates option doesn't affect your production by choosing anything. **The update window does not appear during the initial production.**

So you just have to make it as checked.

**\*Push App Update If your app is released on the Play Store/App Store, etc., you will need to upload a new version of the app to get the app updated through the Store.**

If your app is for personal use that hasn't been released, launch the app and you'll see an update window. You can get the update by reinstalling it.

The push app is built in less than 10 minutes.

The finished app can be viewed by using the official Swing2App \[App Preview] or by downloading the e-mailed APK file from your Android phone.

\*Webview and apps made with push can only be viewed on Android phones. \*You can't check it on your iPhone.

Creating an app is simple, so you can easily follow it by looking at the manual.

The production is free of charge without any extra charge.

Therefore, **you need to apply a homepage of which you have proof that you created it with domain registration information, and a website (homepage) that can be verified by a business registration certificate if it is created by the company.**



**Q. If it's difficult to make it yourself, but I pay for the development, can I do the above in the Swing-to-App app?**

If you ask us to produce it, we will do it all for you.

From designing icons and splash screen images to creating apps and uploading them to the store.

\*You can check the production agency fee on the Swing to App Custom Package product page. <mark style="color:blue;">**http://www.swing2app.co.kr/view/payment\_list\_by\_recommend\_custom**</mark>

However, you will need to create your own Google developer account to upload to the Play Store and let us know your account.

The App Store requires that an Apple developer account be optional, but if you use your own account, you will need to create your own account and tell us about it.

Accounts are not created in the Swing2App app.

**Q. Can I remove the toolbar that pops up in the push app or change the toolbar design?**

Yes, you can remove the toolbar and modify the toolbar design.

**\[How to remove toolbar]**

\*If you look at the STEP2 design step of the App Creation →, there is a 'Use toolbar' checkbox in the default style options item.

Use the toolbar and check 'No' and save it. Press the \[Update App] button.

If you update your app to the new version after creating the app, the toolbar will be available in the uninstalled version.

**\[How to change the toolbar design]**

**\*In the App Authoring→STEP2 Design Step Advanced Style Options item, you can change the toolbar background color, menu list background color, and menu list text color.**

If you want to change the menus and icons that are displayed in the toolbar, you can modify them by selecting the toolbar menu in Step -MENU Settings on page STEP3.

Icons can also be changed as you modify the menu.

Please edit it and save it. Press the \[Update App] button.

If you update your app to the new version after creating the app, the toolbar will be available in the uninstalled version.

\*However, the toolbar design will not be visible in previous versions of V2 as it was updated on 06/07/2022.

You'll need to switch from V2 to V3 and work on the V3 version.

**Q. Can I switch from a push app to a webview version or update from a webview app to a push app?**

Yes you can. \*During the App Creation →STEP2 design phase, please change the prototype to 'WebView' and save and update the app again.

If you update to the new version, the prototype will be changed and you will be able to see it.

If your app has been released on the Play Store, App Store, etc., you can update it to the newly created version as well.

\*However, users who use push unlimited products should not be changed.

**Q. How do I change the weblink address after creating a push app?**

The same goes for changing the weblink address applied to your app.

A**pp Creation→ STEP3 Page Menu 1)Enter the URL Address in the Website Address field → 2)Select the Save button**

\*Modifying the web link address is automatically reflected in the app by simply pressing the Save button.

\*If you exit the app and relaunch it, it will be applied to the changed website.

\*However, users of Push Unlimited Paid App Subscription will need to save and re-create the app. You will need to update to the new version to be reflected.

**Q. Will the push app change to a normal prototype?**

**After being built as a push-only prototype, → cannot be changed to a regular prototype (slide, top, footer, drop-down list, drop-down box).**

\*If you need to change from a push-based to a different prototype, you'll need to create a new app.

**Q. Will the push app reflect what is being modified or updated on the website right away?**

Because your web app is a website-linked application, the screen you see on your website is reflected in the app as well.

Even if you don't have to do anything extra in the app, updates from the web are automatically reflected in the app as well.

**Q. Can the functions that work normally on the mobile web not be available in the app?**

If there's no problem on the web, the app won't have the problem either. However, technical errors can occur at any time.

So, if you have anything problematic while testing your app before launch, please leave it to us at Swing2App help.

We are here to help by identifying your symptoms.
