**3. Play Store Policy Changes**

1. **Change update settings\_2018.04 policy change**\
   Due to the Google policy change in April, the update window does not appear immediately in the app when updating, and it has been changed to receive updates through the Play Store.\
   – **Play Store does not support soft updates. Therefore, if you have updated the app, you must update to the corresponding version of the app in the Play Store.**\
   **– On Android phones, even if the app downloaded from the Play Store is updated, a separate update guide window does not appear when running the app.**\
   **– It is automatically updated on the user’s device according to the Google Play update settings set for each Android phone.**\
   It is the user’s choice whether to update or not for each user, so the time to reflect the app update on the phone is also different.
2. **Old version Android phone not supported\_2019.01 policy change**\
   Apps released on the Google Play Store cannot be used on mobile phones with Android version 4.3 or lower.\
   In older versions of Android phones, Google no longer supports the app, so even if the app is released on the Play Store, users using that version cannot install the app.
3. **Google App Filtering**\
   Even if the Google app is normally released on the Play Store, the app may suddenly go down after a certain period of time.\
   (Filtering after the app is released is more difficult than the initial screening because the researcher directly checks the contents.)\
   When the app is deleted, Google sends the reason for the policy violation to the user’s Google developer account email.\
   If you check the contents and follow the measures, the app will be restored again unless there is a violation of the policy. \_**Please understand that we do not resolve issues that occur after the app is released.**
4. **App search exposure policy change\_2019.10 policy**\
   \*Changed App Search Exposure Policy: No search by app name\
   Even if the app is released on the Play Store, the app is not immediately searched or exposed on the Play Store.\
   In order to prevent indiscriminate launch of apps due to changes in Google’s algorithm, we are changing search exposure after determining the degree of activation (number of app installations) of released apps.\
   Therefore, the app name may not be immediately exposed when the app is released, and if there is no problem after checking the usage status of the app, it will be converted to exposure.\
   Users are encouraged to download the app using the release URL link. After some time, the app name search will be exposed.
5. **Submit web-view app prior notice document\_2020.01 Policy**\
   \*Submission of documentary evidence according to Google’s web-view spam policy\
   When releasing on the Play Store as a web-view or push version app, **you must submit a business registration certificate and website domain registration information documents that can confirm the business information of the website.**\
   \*Web-view spam policy is a policy to determine whether the website linked to the app belongs to the user or not to use someone else’s website without permission.\
   Therefore, if you submit the above proof documents from the application review submission, you can release the app without any problems.\
   If you are uploading to us, we will receive the documents and submit them together. If you are uploading directly, please submit the documents in the store registration information.\
   (You can also send the documents by e-mail in advance after applying for upload. Market Upload Team’s e-mail address: market@swing2app.com)\
   \*If you use other websites, Naver, Daum, etc. portals, SNS, YouTube, or someone else’s website without permission, it is a violation of webview domain ownership and cannot be released on the Play Store.
6. **Prohibition of automatic update (soft update) in the app\_ 2020.03 Policy**\
   New Google Policy: “Apps distributed through Google Play may not modify, replace or update themselves using methods other than Google Play’s update mechanism.”\
   A new policy has been added to prohibit in-app automatic updates.\
   – Please do not use the app update during the Play Store review. (If the app version is different during the review, the app review will be rejected)\
   – If you update the Play Store after the app is released, you must update the App to the corresponding version on the Play Store as well.\
   \*When using the Play Store app, please select either a soft update or a hard update (reinstall the app) to proceed with the update.\
   \*Existing user action\
   For Play Store app users, if the last update is a soft update, change to a hard update and update the new version APK file to the Play Store.
7. **Required to apply in-app payment module when selling digital products within the app \_ Policy reflection date January 20, 2021 \* Existing apps will be reflected from September 30, 2021**\
   In the future, if you distribute an app that sells digital products (excluding physical products) within the app, you cannot use existing electronic payment services such as card payment, and only the Google in-app payment module can be applied.\
   Apple is already applying Apple’s in-app payment module when selling digital products.\
   Since the Google Play Store is also subject to change, if you are preparing such a shopping mall app, please check the policy in advance and refer to it.\
   \*View details of Google in-app payment module policy: [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738)\
   Existing users must also remove mobile electronic payments (Pay App, Naver Pay, etc.) from the app in accordance with the policy change date and change all of them to in-app.
