### ![](https://ncdn2.swing2app.co.kr/public/swing\_notice\_editor\_attach/10271686/20233303.png) **Adding individual links to a survey**&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/EN설문조사1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We've added an individual link feature that allows you to link survey pages individually to the app menu.

**Individual Survey Links is** a feature that allows you to select only one survey and link to the menu.&#x20;

Previously, all registered surveys were displayed on one page, but in the updated function, you can select individual links to link to the menu so that only one survey is shown.



<mark style="color:blue;">**TIP**</mark>

\-When releasing new questionnaires at a specific time, you can open and use multiple questionnaires one by one according to your schedule.

\-In this way, you can prevent the disclosure of questionnaires that have not even begun.

\-It is possible to link questionnaires on different topics by menu to receive a variety of questionnaires from users.

Please check the existing survey page application screen and the screen applied as an individual link to the survey.

When applied to an existing page, all registered surveys will be active on one page.

When you apply an individual link, only one linked survey is shown, and the survey starts immediately.
