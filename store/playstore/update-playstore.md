> <mark style="color:orange;">**1. Important \[App search not exposed]**</mark>

**Even if the app is normally released on the Play Store, it is not immediately exposed in the store when searching for the app name. \*important!\***

\*After determining the degree of activation (number of app installations) of apps released due to Google algorithm change in September 2019, search exposure is being changed.

If the app is released normally, there is no problem. After the app is released, go to the release link and receive a lot of app installations, and please manage it by posting reviews and ratings.

If the app has been released and the number of activations using the app is low, the exposure of the app will be delayed.

If the search by app name does not work well for more than 2 weeks after installation and activation, please contact the Google Developer Customer Center for assistance.

\*If you have any difficulties in finding the app, please contact the Google Developer Support Team (Customer Center).
