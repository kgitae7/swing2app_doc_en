**How to move Play Store apps to another developer account (app transfer guide)**

There are times when you need to release an app to the Play Store and move the app you’re running to another Google developer account.

At this time, Google provides an app transfer service that allows you to move the released app to another account.

Please refer to the Swing2App article for instructions on how to transfer your app to another Google Developer account.
