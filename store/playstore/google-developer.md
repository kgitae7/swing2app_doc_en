![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/g\_dev.png)

To register your app on the Play Store, you’ll need to create a Google developer account first.

<mark style="color:red;">****</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**★What is a Google developer account?**</mark>

\-This is a developer account that you need to create to release your app on the Play Store. You can create a Google Developer account with a registration fee.

\-Account registration fee: $25 (one-time payment, approximately 30,000 in Korean won)

**\*Google Play Developer Console Site** [**https://play.google.com/apps/publish/**](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/)

\*Just because you have a regular Gmail account doesn’t mean that it’s a Google developer account!

The account that paid $25 registration fee in Google Console becomes a developer account!



**– If you have an existing Google Gmail account, you can link it to a developer.**

**– If you don’t, you can create a Gmail account and create a developer account.**

Please check the manual to create a developer account with an existing Google account (Gmail), and to register a developer account by creating a new Google account.
