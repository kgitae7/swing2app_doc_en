**How to release the Play Store private app (Alpha test released)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**▶ What is the Alpha release?**</mark>

This is a program that releases the app privately, rather than the official launch of PlayStore so that only users who are registered by the administrator can use the app.

It can be used by administrators for testing purposes or within certain groups, such as companies.

\-In the alpha version, you can add a list of users who want to use the test version app, so only those users can share it.

\-When the Alpha App is released, a test participation URL is also issued, so only invited users can view the app.

–This allows administrators to use the Alpha release method if they first need to check the test version of the app.

And after you’ve done the test, the app can be officially released back into production.

\*PlayStore – Private app launch can also be registered only with Swing2App paid app or free commercial version app. (The free version is not available\~)

\*Test releases are not available on the Swing2App. Only official releases are available.
