**How to change your Google Play Store developer name**

▶ What is the developer name?

The developer name is the name of the user who publishes your app on the Play Store and runs it.\


Your developer name will appear under the name of your app as it appears in the store.

When you register for your first developer account, you enter the developer’s name, and Google can change the developer name after the app is released.
