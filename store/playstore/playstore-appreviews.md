**How to reply to Play Store app reviews**

When a user who downloads an app on the Play Store writes a review, does the developer know where to reply to the review?

\-A reply cannot be done in the app.

– You can check your reviews and reply by logging in with your Google Developer account on the Developer Console site.

See how to reply to Play Store app reviews in the Swing2App article.

If you select the **\[Ratings and Reviews] menu in the left category, you can check the grade, review analysis, review, and test menus.**

The grade menu is a menu that is often used with reviews because you can check the app’s overall rating and rating statistics.

On the review page, each review has a flag icon.

This icon is the Report button.&#x20;

**You can report a review and delete a post through the Report Review button.**&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">\*Reporting a review does not delete the review immediately, and Google checks if it is legitimate and processes it after approval.</mark>

Therefore, it cannot be reported simply for giving a low star rating.

Please keep this in mind as we will approve any content such as promotional text, slander, or abusive language.
