**Submitting the Google Play Store advance notice**

When launching the Google Play Store app, you can submit a pre-announcement document for reference during review.

<mark style="color:purple;">**\*\*If you are releasing an app with a web view app or a push version app, you must submit a pre-notification document, so please check the posting to check the submission documents and submission method.**</mark>

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line"> <mark style="color:green;">**What is an advance notice document?**</mark>

When registering an app on the Play Store, **you are submitting documents proving that the app is not an item that may violate Google policy.**

**Therefore, the advance notice document is to prove that the app does not have any problems by submitting the documents in advance to app review so that the app can be released normally.**

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line"> <mark style="color:green;">**Scenarios for prior notice**</mark>

\-If the app has the right to use third-party intellectual property rights (brand name, website, logo, image, etc.)

\-In case there is a document that proves that it has been made on behalf of the information or government agency

\-If a game with gambling or casino-style elements is certified by the Korean Game Product Management Committee (GRAC)

**If you have created an app that corresponds to the above scenario, you must submit the supporting documents as a pre-notification document when submitting the Play Store app to launch the app normally.**

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/25b6.svg" alt="▶" data-size="line"> <mark style="color:green;">**WebView app and Push version app must submit a pre-notification document together.**</mark>

Among those who have created an app with Swing2App, users who have created a **\*webview app or a push version app (a web browser app that connects the website to the app as it is)** must submit the above notice when registering the Play Store app.

The reason is that according to Google’s webview spam policy, **the owner of the website connected to the app is the app developer**.

**Therefore, you need to submit proof of whether the website connected to the app is owned by the business or your own, and generally, you can submit your business registration card or website domain registration information.**

As mentioned above, we have shown you how to submit a pre-notification document that must be registered when submitting a web view app to the Google Play Store in Swing2App.



<mark style="color:red;">**— Precautions —**</mark>

1. Advance notice documents must be submitted at the time of registering the Play Store app (initial registration) so that you can refer to the app (web view app, push app) linked with the web browser as it is.
2. **For apps created by web view or push, you must submit a prior notice document when reviewing the Play Store app. (Required)\_2020.11 Policy Change**\
   Review is possible without submitting the documents, but if you do not submit documents that can prove the website, app review will be rejected.\
   Therefore, it is recommended to submit the documents in advance during app review.
3. If the documents are not submitted and the WebView app spam policy is violated at the final screening, the app will be deleted.\
   You can file proof and get your app restored again, but the process can be tricky and take a lot longer to launch.
4. Therefore, we recommend that users of WebView apps and Push version apps created with Swing2App submit a pre-announcement document when registering the app on the Play Store.
5. For those who entrusted the play store upload agency with Swing2App, if your app is a WebView app or a Push version app, please submit your business registration certificate and website domain registration information file separately via Swing2App email.\
   \*If you have applied for upload, the person in charge will send you an upload guide email and guide you to submit the above documents. Then you can reply by e-mail.
6. Even if it is not a web view app or a push version app, if there is any content that corresponds to the above scenario among apps made with a general prototype, you must submit a notice in advance. (E.g., proof of use of third-party intellectual property rights, etc.)
