# Play Store App Search TIP

In the case of Google, even if the app name is properly searched, sometimes it is not placed on the top of the list.&#x20;

Therefore, even if you launch the app and searched for the app name, the app may not be well exposed.

In this case, it usually takes a bit of time after launch, or when the number of app downloads occurs, it’s naturally filtered up and re-positioned.

In some cases, the apps are placed on top from the beginning, even if they don’t have to make any extra effort.&#x20;

Is there a way to make the search work better? **Google doesn’t disclose its algorithm for search, so even app developers don’t know how to make the search option work better.**&#x20;

**There are still some basic and general methods, so we will explain them.**&#x20;

**App description) Please enter the keyword that corresponds to the subject line that appears when you search in the Market.**

**Tip) If you have an initial app with no downloads, the best way to get to the top is to match your keywords and your app title**.

Appropriate use can help a lot, but if you’re greedy and use generic nouns as your app title (e.g. hospitals, libraries, schools, etc.), your app name will be less personal.&#x20;

As a result, re-download rates and brand promotions may be less effective, and search satisfaction is not good because many competing apps use those keywords.&#x20;

**You can achieve good results by mixing your name and key nouns appropriately.**\


Ex ) Employment is a Korean job app! -Bonds, interviews, and job applications

Ex ) CJmall – New hot deals and coupon discounts every day!

Ex ) G Market – Shopping starts and ends in the G Market app.

**★Precautions**

**You might think it would be nice to have a lot of keywords.**&#x20;

**\*\* Google prohibits writing keywords.**&#x20;

**Be careful when listing keywords repeatedly or excessively, or listing keywords that aren’t relevant to your app, as they may cause your app to be suspended or removed due to metadata violations.**

Ex) Puppy, cat, pet dog, pet cat, dog food, cat food…… Please do not overuse the keywords like this.
