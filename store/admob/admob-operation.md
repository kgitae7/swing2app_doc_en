**AdMob Operations – Adding payment information, checking un-reviewed and blocked ads**

After applying for Admob Operation, you should be familiar with how to operate Admob ads.

**1) Enter your payment information**

If your admob payment information is missing, your ads won’t be displayed.

**2) Manage un-reviewed and blocked ads**

If the ad is not reviewed, it will not be displayed in the app. If you see any un-reviewed ads, you should check and change them to review.
