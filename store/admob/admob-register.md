**How to sign up for AdMob and how to create an AdMob Ad Unit ID**

**▶ **<mark style="color:blue;">**What is Google AdMob?**</mark>

AdMob is an advertising platform provided by Google that allows you to place ads in your app.

You can monetize your ads by applying the ad platform to your app.

**▶ **<mark style="color:blue;">**How do I apply AdMob to my app?**</mark>

In the ad mob plug-in settings provided by Swing to App, the app operator can set up the advertisement with the app that I created.\
\*AdMob setting is available only when you purchase an AdMob Plug-in product or AdMob Power Package.

**▶ **<mark style="color:blue;">**What should the user do?**</mark>

1\)Please subscribe to the Google ad-mob official website. (Login in if you have an account)

2\) After adding an app to apply the advertisement, create an advertising unit ID.(BANNER+Front)

3\) Please enter the ad-mob payment information (it is listed on the ad-mob dashboard, and if it is not written, post an ad X)

4\)Advertisement management checks if there are any unreviewed or blocked advertisements.

5\)If you’re done making it, you can save it by entering the advertising unit ID, app ID, and ad exposure pattern created in the ad mob plug-in settings.

If you re-produce the app and check the updated version again, you can check the screen with the advertisement.

**You can check the ad-mob plug-in setting advertisement setting in detail in the manual below.**

<mark style="color:blue;">**▶ Why create an ad unit ID?**</mark>

To add ads to your app, you need the **app’s unique ad unit ID**.

There is a unique ID that applies to Android phones and iPhones.

There are also IDs depending on the type of advertisement.

This allows users to create their ad unit IDs and apply them to the app to make their ads look normal.

**+Android banner, front ad ID**

**+iPhone banner, front ad ID**

\+**Android App ID,  iPhone App ID**

Please enter the **\[Add payment information]** menu.

From the left menu, go to the \[Manage Block] menu.



<mark style="color:blue;">**1) Un-reviewed ads**</mark>

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ad5-1.png)

By selecting the \[Reviewed Ads] menu, you’ll see that previously un-reviewed ads are “reviewed.

So, select the \[Blocked] menu to see if any of the ads that have been applied to your app are blocked.

If no ads are blocked, they will appear like the image above, but if there are ads that are blocked, they will appear together on the screen.

You should check it out and review it before removing the blocked ads.
