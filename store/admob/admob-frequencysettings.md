**\* Google AdMob ads are recommended for automatic settings.**

<mark style="color:red;">★Automatic settings automatically set the frequency of ad impressions on the user’s phone, depending on the number of app downloads and the number of times the app was used.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">“Google Optimization” automatically sets your ad impressions according to the standards set by Google!!</mark>

Advertisement change as often on mobile phones with the app.

Apps with high app installs are also filtered to determine ad impressions.

Therefore, if you specify the time artificially, the above contents are not reflected at all, so the advertising effect may below.

Therefore, we recommend setting the exposure time automatically.

Optionally, you can change the setting time and change it back to Auto.

<mark style="color:red;">**★ Information**</mark>

**Banner ads are changing to new ads based on frequency.**&#x20;

**Occasionally, we ask you to change your banner ad every time you select an app page or post.**

**Apps are not installed in that way.**&#x20;

**Please note that this is in violation of google’s policies, so if you edit the ad display format, your ads may be deleted or your AdMob account may be deleted.**

**And as **<mark style="color:red;">**mentioned above banner ad impression frequency is best set to the automatic setting (auto refresh)-Google optimization.**</mark>

The guide to ad exposure time is useful for those who have just released an app.

If you’re running your app to a certain extent, please use it with automatic settings (auto-refresh).

I hope this helps.
