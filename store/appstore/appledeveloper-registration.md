As mentioned above, when registering as a company, you need to get a DUNS number.\
A company called D & B can be issued for a certain fee.\
You can send an email by selecting the email D & B above.\
\
If you apply directly from the Apple site, you can get it for free.\
Of course, it may take some time to issue.\
&#xNAN;**\*\* When applying for a D-U-N-S number with Apple, please send it to the email address below with five details.**\\

> \*E-mail address: appdeveloper@dnb.com\
> 1\. Company name:\

**Request a DUNS Number**

D & B may have already assigned a free DUNS number to your company.

Before you register, use the [D-U-N-S number lookup tool ](https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/)to make sure you have a D-U-N-S number assigned.

If your company is not listed, you can submit your company information to Dun & Bradstreet for a free DUNS number.

When you request a DUNS number using the [D‑U‑N‑S number lookup tool ](https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/)you will be asked to provide the following information.

**-Corporate name**\
&#xNAN;**-Head office address**\
&#xNAN;**-Postal address**\

As part of the verification process, your D & B representative may contact you directly for additional information such as type of business and number of employees.

Please have your business registration documents ready.
