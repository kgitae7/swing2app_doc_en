Apple can choose between **phone support and email answers**.\
You can leave a phone number and the person in charge will be asked to call you, or you can receive a reply by email.\
You can call us between 9 AM to 5 PM.

In Apple’s case, however, the method of application depends on the contents of the inquiry.\
Please note that you may need to send an email unconditionally.\
\
Apple, like Google, has a simple inquiry, and if you leave your phone number through a callback, you can call it from the help center.\
If you have a variety of inquiries after the app launch, we hope you help us use the above method. ^^\
