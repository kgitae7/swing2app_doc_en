An option has been added to allow users to set whether the progress bar is displayed in the web app.&#x20;

If you do not want it to be shown, you can disable its use in the advanced settings, making it invisible in the app.&#x20;

With the addition of the progress bar removal feature, checking 'Not in Use' will make it not visible.

A progress bar is a progress indicator displayed at the top of the mobile web.&#x20;

It is a horizontally long bar that visually shows how much of a task has been completed.&#x20;

You can think of it as similar in meaning to 'loading'.&#x20;

The progress bar can be seen in web apps connected to mobile websites - WebView, and in push apps.



#### <mark style="color:orange;">**\*When using the progress bar, it is possible to change its color.**</mark>&#x20;

Please refer to the help guide for the method of changing the color.
