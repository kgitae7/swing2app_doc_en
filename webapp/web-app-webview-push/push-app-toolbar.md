# Push-app toolbar

**V3 PushApp Toolbar Function Introduction Manual – How to Use**

​

Here is the Push Toolbar Function Manual.

For push only, you can use the 'toolbar' function when creating apps. (Not available in the webview app.)

A toolbar area is created at the bottom of the app screen to take advantage of its various functions.

The toolbar is a feature only available in push apps, and in the V3 version, the toolbar functionality has been updated in different ways.

Previously you only had to use the toolbar provided.

In V3, you can configure the toolbar directly with any menu you want, modify icons, modify the design, and customize the toolbar area yourself.

Check out the manual to see how to use the toolbar and how you can apply its features to your app.

> \-Auto-hide refers to the function that the toolbar disappears for a while when scrolling and moving it down the screen,
