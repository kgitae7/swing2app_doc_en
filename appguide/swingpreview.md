A sub-administrator is an administrator who selects members and gives them administrator rights.

**↓↓ Below, we’ll show you how to set up a Sub administrator.**

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/push\_not.png)

**Manager page → Push & Member → Member Views menu.**

On the member inquiry page, you can check the list of members subscribed to the app.

![](https://support.swing2app.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/group\_ch.png)

Select a member and click on the name, and the member information window will appear as shown in the image above.

**Select \[Current Group Information] → select ‘ADMIN” → select \[Change Group]** to complete the change.

The former user will be changed to ‘ADMIN’.

The sub administrator can set it up like this.

You can use this method when logging in to the sub administrator in Swing2App Preview.

In addition, there is no separate name of ‘Sub-Administrator’ and it is used as an administrator.
