Unlimited paid app products for webviews and push-only do not include upload tickets (Play Store, App Store).

You will need to purchase and apply for a Store upload ticket that you want to launch and update on the Play Store, App Store, etc.

We recommend that you purchase unlimited packages that come with upload tickets.&#x20;

<summary>Is there any cost to use the app in the future when I purchase a webview or push unlimited subscription?</summary>

Since it is an unlimited product, so you can use it for a lifetime when you purchase a subscription.

There are no additional usage fees to be paid.

However, if the app is updated, the app must be updated by the store, so you may need to purchase additional products such as App Store upload tickets and Play Store upload tickets.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use unlimited Android or iPhone products and change them to Integrated (Android + iPhone)?</summary>

Yes you can.

For example, if you add an iPhone while using \[Push Only Unlimited Android $250]â†’ you can purchase the \[Push Only Unlimited iPhone $350] product.

If you purchase additional products, they can be used together in an integrated format.

In addition, the App Store upload ticket ( $20) must be purchased separately.

(App Store upload launch agency cost)

However, if you purchase each product separately, it will be more expensive than the integrated type, so if you are going to run Android + iPhone, it will be more expensive to purchase and use the integrated type from the beginning.

<details>

<summary>When I purchase a webview, push unlimited subscription, will the app switch to unlimited right away?</summary>

The development team will set aside unlimited servers, so even if your payment is complete, you won't be able to switch right away.

The development team will handle it separately within 1-2 hours, and you can use it as an app with an unlimited usage period after you send the notification e-mail.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do apps that are available in the Store need to be updated after purchasing a webview, push unlimited subscription?</summary>

App updates are essential because you need to set aside unlimited servers.

Therefore, you will need to update the Play Store and the App Store again with an updated version of the app.

A new version of the app must be uploaded to the Store for existing users to receive and use the update, and new users can also use it as an app with push restrictions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I change to unlimited products while using the basic subscription?</summary>

Yes you can.

If you are using the basic subscription, you can change it to unlimited products at the end of the use and purchase it.

However, since partial refunds are not possible for the remaining period of use, it is recommended that you purchase the product after the end of the service period.

(If you don't mind a partial refund, you can buy it right away while you're using it.)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use unlimited integration and change to only one platform for iPhone or Android?</summary>

It is not possible.

Users can make apps invisible by deleting or unpublishing apps from individually released stores.

For example, if you only use the Play Store Android phone, and you stop using the App Store, you can proceed by unloading the app that has been released to the App Store.

We cannot take any action, such as discontinuing the use of the app on the user's phone, and we will not refund it by deducting the cost of the unlimited paid app product price that you do not use.

<details>

<summary>Please tell us the steps to proceed after purchasing the webview and push unlimited passes.</summary>

1\) After the app is finished creating, please purchase unlimited use for push-only and store upload tickets.

Alternatively, we recommend that you purchase a package that includes all your upload tickets.

2\) When you purchase an unlimited subscription, the development team will set aside unlimited servers and re-create the app in a new version.

(It takes 1-2 hours, and the setting time may be delayed when applying outside of business hours.)

This means that unlimited access will not be used immediately, even if payment is completed.

3\) When the operation is completed, a completion notification e-mail will be sent to the user.

From the time you receive the completion email, you will be able to use the app with an unlimited trial period.

4\) We will send you a list of the store launch method and upload application method through the notification e-mail, so please check the contents and apply for upload.

You can receive an upload request to release your app to the Play Store, App Store, etc.
