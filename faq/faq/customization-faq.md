# Customization FAQ

<details>

<summary>What is customization?</summary>

Customization is a ‘custom-made service’ to create products according to the needs of customers.

You can ask Swing2App to customize and develop your app as per your requirement.

If you wish to add features other than built-in services provided in Swing2App, or if you need an overall app development, you can ask us to customize your app.

We will create a custom app with your desired content and calculate a quote based on your app development.

Therefore, if you have a customization request, kindly create a proposal, storyboard, etc. for our better understanding.&#x20;

Customization will generate a quote based on the content of the app development. Our engineers will assist you in the detailed consultation of the development period and the work details.&#x20;

For customized consultations, please first prepare and send the app production proposal, storyboard, etc. to <mark style="color:blue;">help@swing2app.com</mark>.

Simple features or custom features that have already been provided by Swing2App can be guided directly from the Help Center, but please understand that the overall development of the app and the complex content configuration cannot be assisted in consultation without a specific proposal.

<summary>How do get a customized consultation and quote?</summary>

The customization consultation can be discussed by sending the plan, storyboard, etc. for app development by swing2app email.

The entire app development and complex development is difficult to consult by phone or katok.

\*Please prepare an app creation plan, storyboard, etc. and send it to [help@swing2app.com](https://support.swing2app.com/custormizing/?preview\_id=4445\&preview\_nonce=82585d04da&\_thumbnail\_id=-1\&preview=true) with your swing2app email address. (Contact us with your contact information)

If you send an email, the custom development engineer will check the contents and will provide you with a list of development options, development period, and development cost estimates

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the approximate cost of customization?</summary>

Swing2App custom is not price constrained, so there is no cost.

And because it’s a 1:1 development work that reflects the user’s custom content, there are no development estimates.

Estimates can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars depending on the content of the production, so there is no custom cost.

Therefore, please note that we only provide customized quotes through consultation.

<details>

<summary>Can you customize the app the same as per user request?</summary>

Yes, we can customize your app as per your requirement. Please tell us the name of the app you want to benchmark and we’ll be happy to guide you.

We can check the app and see if the same app development is possible, accordingly our engineer will guide you.

For apps with simple design and production methods, engineers can check and guide you with custom costs.

**However, for apps that have a lot of internal development sources besides the content and complexity of the app, it may be difficult to calculate the exact development cost.**

(The internal development source of a particular app cannot be verified only by looking at the app, and it can only be verified until the actual development is made.)

\*And make it clear whether you want the design and the configuration forms to be the same, if only the shapes are similar, or if you want to put only a specific menu on both.

You can send your email to [help@swing2app.com](https://support.swing2app.com/custormizing/?preview\_id=4445\&preview\_nonce=82585d04da&\_thumbnail\_id=-1\&preview=true) and give us your custom inquiry, but please let us know the exact app development request.

<summary>Is there an additional cost if I add the same customized content to another app?</summary>

If you add it to another app with the same content after customizing it, you will be charged $100 for the license.

The reason for the additional cost of applying it to other apps with the same content is that it is not a development fee, but a license fee.

License fees are essential policies to prevent indiscriminate use of custom programs.

The cost of customizing development is based on one app and will receive an additional license fee when you expand.

Therefore, please note that there is an additional cost of $100 for the license copy.

<summary>How to handle a customization failure?</summary>

If there are any errors or failures in the application of customization, it will be dealt with immediately.

However, we cannot continue to monitor users’ apps in the swing2app.

Therefore, if users who have been customized have problems using the app, they will need to contact our customer service or contact us via email to confirm and process it.

We will of course handle the failures and maintenance incurred by customization at no additional cost.

\*We can’t handle any errors that occurred outside of us other than failures of errors like  (swing2app, and custom content) and the developer will notify you after confirmation.
