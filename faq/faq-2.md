<summary>Can't test an app I've created on an iPhone?</summary>

The app can also be tested on iPhone.

Here are 2 ways to do it.

**1)When using the free version app - Use the Swing to App app preview**

Download and install the official \[Swing to App] app from the App Store.

Launch the app, select the \[App Preview] menu at the top, log in with your Swing-to-App account - you can preview the app you created as a preview on your iPhone.

\*You can check all the apps you create for free.

\*Only Prototype - Apps created with Push or WebView are not available for preview (only apps created by regular prototypes - slides, tops, footers, etc.)

**2) When using the paid version of the app - register the test version with the user's Apple ID 'test-flight'\\**

You can test using test-flight provided by the App Store.

Please purchase a paid app pass, an App Store upload ticket, and apply for an App Store upload.

Email after completion of upload application: Please email the App Store test-flight request to the help@swing2app.co.kr.

Please collect and send us all the Apple accounts (email addresses) of users who want to use the iPhone app.

The audit takes 3 to 5 days, and once it's complete, you can install the app on your iPhone to test it.

The test-flight is only available for 90 days, and if you do extend, you will need to purchase an App Store upload ticket and reapply for the upload.

\* This applies to the paid version and requires you to purchase an App Store upload ticket and apply for an upload. ( Swing Paid Use Pass must be paid.)

<summary>When installing the Android phone application, it says that it is from an unknown source.</summary>

Currently, Google defaults to warning about apps installed from sources other than the Google Play Store.

Therefore, if you received your app through an external channel other than the official Play Store, you may receive this message.

On your Android phone, you can install the downloaded application by checking **"Settings> Security > Unknown Sources".**

Of course, if your app has been uploaded to the Play Store, you won't be able to see these messages, so uploading to the Market will solve it simply.

In addition, you can select and proceed with the protection security message as 'Ignore and install'.&#x20;

<summary>If I update my app after it's built, how will users of existing versions get the update?</summary>

An update message window appears when the app runs, so users can get the update to the latest version.

Currently, when making updates in Swing-to-App AppProduction, administrators can choose 'Recommended', 'Required', and 'Do not show updates' themselves.

Depending on the option chosen, the contents of the message window will vary, and if 'Required' is selected, the user must update before they can use the app normally.

If your app is registered on the App Store or Play Store after switching to the paid version, you will need to update the newly updated version of the app again on that Store.

Only when it is updated will users be able to use the changed content.

<summary>After switching to a paid app, I get a 'Blocked by Play Protect' message when I download the app.</summary>

<img src="https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/%EC%9C%A0%EB%A3%8C%EC%95%B1-%EB%AF%B8%EC%84%A4%EC%B9%981.png" alt="" data-size="original">

When you try to install a paid app that has been switched to it, you may get a 'Blocked by Play Protect' message, as shown in the image above.

Before you launch (register) on the Play Store, if you download from an external channel other than the official Play Store, Google Protect will display the message.

In this case, you can select \[Ignore and install] and you can install normally.

When you release an app to the Play Store, you won't see that message.

<summary>After switching to a paid app, I download the app and get the message "The app is not installed."</summary>

<img src="https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/%EA%B5%AC%EA%B8%80%EC%A0%95%EC%B1%855-506x1024.png" alt="" data-size="original">

The message is also a case in which Google blocked the installation of the app on its own.

If you don't launch the Play Store, Google will recognize it as an unknown path and arbitrarily block the installation, which will result in a case where you can't install it properly.

**Paid apps made with Swing-to-App that are not available on the Play Store have been identified as unauthenticated paths on Android phones and have been blocked from installation.**

Disable Protect security settings in the PlayStore app for easy trouble.

**\* In the Play Store app → 'Play Protect', we recommend →that you deselect "Scan your device for security threats" and "Supplement the ability to detect harmful apps".**
