Members who have already signed up for Swing have already signed up and will not be counted as affiliate users.

By accessing the user's affiliate URL, only new members who have registered from that URL will be counted.

Therefore, please remember that only new members are eligible for users who have entered the affiliate program\~!!

<summary>How are user settlements aggregated?</summary>

Among the times that have accessed the user's affiliate URL, the settlement will be settled only for the actual payment such as deposit, card payment, etc.

<summary>How does the Swing Affiliate Program review work?</summary>

When you apply for the Swing Affiliate Program, a representative will conduct the review.

Screening is not tricky.

First, make sure you have a proper homepage to promote your swing, and that it's not a site with no activity at all.

In addition, make sure that it is a faithfully written introduction to check the company introduction letter and the introduction materials that you attach when you apply.

Check the map with a lot of other users' connections to comprehensively determine the applicant for the swing affiliate program.

The audit will take about 1 day.

<details>

<summary>Is it just the ticket sales of the swing that are dividended?</summary>

Yes that's right.

Only subscription sales will be dividends, and since more than 90% of the current swing sales are subscription sales, there will be no significant difference in the amount of dividends.

In addition to the license, it does not apply to unlimited passes, plug-in products, upload tickets, capacity purchase rights, SMS purchases, etc.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the payout date and settlement method?</summary>

It will be settled on the 1st day of each month.

Please note that the previous month's sales will be aggregated and settled until the 25th of the previous month.

<summary>After signing up to access the site with the affiliate program at the beginning, and later accessing it with a separate swing URL, will you not become an incoming user?</summary>

No. If you initially connect as an incoming user and then sign up, you will continue to be an influx user of the affiliate program even if the time passes or the computer changes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will I continue to receive Swing Affiliate Program revenue?</summary>

Users brought into the four affiliate programs become users who are caught up in lifetime revenue.

As a result, you can continue to receive dividends (commissions) for the products purchased by that user.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The affiliate program has been approved. So how do you promote your swing?</summary>

We will provide a swing promotion banner image to the affiliate program applicant's email.

The applicant places a banner on a site such as the homepage he or she operates, and enters the URL of the affiliate link.

(Once approved, the applicant's unique URL to the swing will be registered, and the applicant will be able to receive dividends through the influx of other users entering the link.)

In addition to posting banners on your site, you can also share the link with other users with Katok.

SNS – You can use Facebook, Instagram and more to promote yourself.

The more publicity you do, the more people you come in, so you can promote it in a variety of ways.
