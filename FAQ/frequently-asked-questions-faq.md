# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>

<summary>What is the difference between the paid version and the free version?</summary>

**The first difference between a paid version and a free version is being able to launch (commercialized) in the Store and not being able to do it.**

\-Free is only available as an Android phone installation file, and paid can be commercialized and released on Play Store, App Store, etc.

\-The paid version can be distributed to stores such as the Play Store, the App Store, etc. This means you can release apps that you have created in the Store.

**Secondly, there is a difference in the storage capacity.**

The Free version comes with a basic 100MB capacity, while the paid version offers 2GB to 50 GB. (Depending on the product, the amount of the paid version app varies)

**The third difference is, that number of app productions is different.**

Paid users can create up to 10 apps per account, and free users can create up to 3 apps per account.

In addition, there are differences in the number of bulletin board productions, the number of group chat rooms, and the limit of the number of users.

Most features are available in the free version, so try it out for free and switch to paid when ready.

<summary><strong>How long do I need to wait for my app to be released in each store?</strong></summary>

**\[App Store]**

The app Store review period is a minimum of 7 days.

If there are no issues with the review, the app will be released within 7 days. In some cases, the app release can take even more than 7 days, because the app gets often rejected during the review phase.

Therefore, please consider these points while applying for app store upload, and make sure to check the review feedback for the reasons for the rejection of the app.

**\[PlayStore]**

Play Store review period takes a minimum of 7 days.

If there are no issues with the review, the app will be released on the store immediately after the above review period, but the app upload on the Play Store may also be delayed in the release date if the review is declined.

Therefore, please consider these points while applying for the app upload.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a Store Upload Agent?</summary>

A paid version of the app (an app with paid app subscription) will be available for commercialization. Users can launch their paid apps in the stores such as the Play Store and the App Store.

If users face difficulty while uploading their app directly to the store, they can apply for the store upload request form. By doing that, on your behalf, the Swing2App team will upload your app to the store.

**In other words, putting an app created by a user on the Store instead is called an upload agency.**

Therefore, **if you request an upload agency, you can apply by purchasing \[App Store Upload Ticket $20], \[Play Store Upload Ticket $10] on the Swing Payment – Swing Pass, Ticket Purchase page.**

After purchasing, you will need to apply for an upload to complete the application. Go to the Version Control →App Creation History menu\*\*,\*\* and **select the \[Request to upload to Play Store] or \[Request for App Store Upload] button in the Market Registration box.**

\*The Play Store allows individual uploads, so if you can upload them yourself, you don't need to buy an upload ticket.

\*The App Store cannot be uploaded directly by the user and can only be released by the upload agency.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When will the number of days of use of paid subscriptions be counted?</summary>

Paid subscriptions are counted for days from the date the pass is paid.

For example, if you paid on March 4th, the period of use starts on the 4th.

**If you need to put your app on the stove, please purchase a paid pass and upload ticket after the app is finished creating.**

<details>

<summary>How do I get AAB files that I can register on the Play Store?</summary>

AAB files are not available in the free version of the app, but only in the paid version of the app where you have purchased a subscription to the paid app.

(Free version app users can only provide APK file)

<summary>If I purchase my subscription again long after the expiration of the subscription period, will the app be able to use it normally?</summary>

Yes, the expiration of the subscription period does not delete the app, so you can purchase it later.

The app will switch to the free version.

<mark style="color:red;">\*Users who download the app from the App Store or Play Store when switching to the free version will not be able to use the app.</mark>

So if you buy your pass again later, the app will be automatically restored and you can use it normally.

Apps from users who downloaded apps from the Store will also be restored to normal.

However, after the launch of the app such as the app store, play store, etc., we will check whether it is being used well.

At this time, <mark style="color:red;">if the app is discontinued, it will be removed from the store because it is not a normal app, so when the period of use ends, it is recommended that you repurchase the subscription and extend the use as soon as possible.</mark>

When an app is deleted from the Store, it can sometimes be difficult to restore the app again, and all existing users will be lost.
