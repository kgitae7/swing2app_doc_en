# Customization FAQ

<details>

<summary>What is customization?</summary>

Customization is a ‘custom-made service’ to create products according to the needs of customers.

You can ask Swing2App to customize and develop your app as per your requirement.

If you wish to add features other than built-in services provided in Swing2App, or if you need an overall app development, you can ask us to customize your app.

We will create a custom app with your desired content and calculate a quote based on your app development.

Therefore, if you have a customization request, kindly create a proposal, storyboard, etc. for our better understanding.&#x20;

Customization will generate a quote based on the content of the app development. Our engineers will assist you in the detailed consultation of the development period and the work details.&#x20;

For customized consultations, please first prepare and send the app production proposal, storyboard, etc. to <mark style="color:blue;">help@swing2app.com</mark>.

Simple features or custom features that have already been provided by Swing2App can be guided directly from the Help Center, but please understand that the overall development of the app and the complex content configuration cannot be assisted in consultation without a specific proposal.

<summary>How do I get a customized consultation and quote?</summary>

Customized consultation is possible only by sending the proposal, storyboard, etc. about the app development to the Swing2App email first.

You must have a specific app production plan so that after confirming the contents, a development engineer can assist you with the consultation. \*Please prepare an app production proposal, storyboard, etc. and send it to the Swing2App email address help@swing2app.co.kr .

If you e-mail, the custom development engineer will check the contents and guide you through whether development is possible, the development period, the development cost estimate, etc., and we will assist you with the consultation.

<summary>Don't know the approximate cost of customization?</summary>

Custom is not a price reconnaissance system.

And since it's a 1:1 development that reflects the user's custom content, there is no development estimate.

Estimates vary in amount from a few hundred thousand won to a few thousand won depending on the content of the production, so there is no custom set cost.

Therefore, we will only guide you through consultation to guide you through a customized quote.

<details>

<summary>Is the app the same as a specific app?</summary>

Sometimes you show us an app on the market and ask if you want to make it the same as this app.

We can check the app and see if the same app development is possible, and the engineer will be able to guide you.

For apps that have a simple design and build methodology, an engineer can check in and guide you through the cost of your customizations.

However, **\*\*In the case of an app that has a lot of development sources internally in addition to the content that is complicated and shown, it can be difficult to estimate the exact development cost.**

(This is because the internal development source of a particular app cannot be verified by looking at the app alone, and only when the actual development is in.)

\*\* And you need to make it clear that you want to make the design and composition the same, if you want to make the shapes similar, or if you want to keep certain menus the same.

You can give us the name of your app and give us a custom inquiry, but please let us know the exact app development request.

<summary>Is there an additional cost if I add the same content to another app after customization?</summary>

If you add the same content to another app after the customization operation, the license fee of KRW 100,000 will be added.

The reason why applying the same content back to another app adds to the cost is that you are charged a licensing fee, not a development fee.

License fees are a necessary policy to prevent indiscriminate use of customization programs.

The target of the custom development fee is based on 1 app, and you will receive an additional license fee when you scale.

Therefore, please keep in mind that the license copy fee will incur an additional cost of 100,000 won.

<summary>How do I handle a customization failure?</summary>

If any errors or failures occur in the customized content, we will take immediate action and deal with them.

However, we can't monitor users' apps on the swing and keep them in control.

Therefore, if customized users have any problems using the app, they must contact our customer service center or contact us via e-mail so that we can confirm and deal with them.

Failure handling and maintenance caused by customization is of course handled by us at no additional cost.

\*Errors that occur outside of us (swing app, customization content) that are not failures or errors cannot be handled by us, and the contents will be confirmed and guided by the developer.
