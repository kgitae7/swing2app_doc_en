<summary>What is the cost of the Admob plugin product? Is it an Android phone or iPhone integration setting?</summary>

**There are 2 products related to the Admob plugin.**

1\) Google Admob application plug-in (220,000 won): A la carte product that is only available with the Admob plug-in

Since Admob is a la carte, you will need to purchase a paid app pass and a store upload ticket separately.

2\) Admob Power Package (580,000 won): Admob application plug-in + Swing basic subscription (2 years/24 months) + 1 upload ticket (App Store upload ticket, Play Store upload ticket) is a package product that comes with it.

In addition to Admob, both passes and store uploads are included, so if you buy just one packaged item, you don't have to buy another.

\=**> Therefore, the product can be used after the user selects the desired style of product.**

To purchase the product, please select the link below and you will be taken to the swing payment page.

**☞ **<mark style="color:blue;">**\[Google Admob Application Plugin Product Page]**</mark>&#x20;

Android and iPhone 2 modes Admob is applicable, and the integration settings are available.

You can only set up the platform you want.

However, if you only have one platform, the cost is the same.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I still use the Admob plugin once I purchase it?</summary>

Admob plugin products require only one purchase and can be used continuously by applying app ads.

There is no additional charge for setting up an admob.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do ads appear in the app?</summary>

It will appear as a default banner ad + a front-facing pop-up ad.

<img src="https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/%EC%95%A0%EB%93%9C%EB%AA%B9%EC%88%98%EC%A0%95_19.11.png" alt="" data-size="original">

**\*Head-to-head ads can be freely set by the app operator for the impression pattern.**

**1)Impressions on the first launch of the app**

\-When you launch the > app for the first time, you will see an overheader.

**2) When the app first screen switch is in progress**

\-After launching the > app, select the first menu, page, etc., and once the screen is switched, a front pop-up ad will appear.

**3)Ad impressions by number of screen conversions**

\-You can set the number of ad impressions that pop up as the > screen switches.

Example)'When set to '5', the full-blown ad will be displayed when the screen is switched five times.

**4)Impressions every certain amount of time**

\->If you set a certain amount of time, after that time, you will see a full-blown ad.

Example) If you set it to 60 seconds, your ad will be shown 60 seconds after the app launches. (Impressions every 60 seconds)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does Admob ad revenue come from, and does the revenue go all the way to the user?</summary>

Ads aren't just profitable just because you run your app.

**\*You will need to tap on the actual ad (banner, front) to go to that ad page to be captured as ad revenue.**

The revenue from the ads is 100% taken by the user.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do I need to create an Admob ad unit ID?</summary>

In order to put ads in your app, you need your app's unique ad unit ID.

It has a unique ID that applies to Android phones and iPhones.

Depending on the form of the advertisement, there is also an ID.

Therefore, the user creates their own ad unit ID and applies the ad unit ID to the app so that the ad can be seen normally.

In order to set up Admob ads in your app, you will need the information below.

**(1) Front-page ad unit ID (Android, iPhone)**

**(2) Banner ad ad unit ID (Android, iPhone)**

**(3) Android App ID, IOS App ID**

<summary>How do I create an Admob ad unit?</summary>

To learn how to sign up and create an ad unit, check out the manual below.

</details>

<details>

<summary>After setting up Admob, can I only check if the ads are showing up on my Android phone?</summary>

Y**ou will need to check the test version on your Android phone.**

The iPhone must be released on the App Store before it can be advertised in the app. (Apps that have not been released due to Apple's policy will not be advertised.)

So the iPhone has to be released on the App Store to see the ads.

**Users should check the advertised screen on their Android phone.**

Ads with iPhone + Android integration settings are the same on the iPhone if the ads look good on an Android phone.

</details>

<details>

<summary>If I click a lot of ads, I get a lot of revenue, can the operator keep clicking on them?</summary>

**Never artificially click on ads.**

Because of invalid traffic, Google will drop ads without notice if there is any suspicious behavior on a particular device (mobile phone). (Indiscriminate ad clicks)

Therefore, you should not continue to choose ads artificially or indiscriminately in order to earn advertising revenue.

If your ad goes down with invalid traffic, there's no other way to do it, and we can't help you.

You'll have to wait for Google to repost your ad. \*This may take up to a month.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I've created all the ad unit IDs, but the ads aren't being posted.</summary>

Admob may not send ads right away even if you complete the settings.

The review period for checking your Admob account and app can take up to a week.

If you do not enter the information below, it may take a long time for the ad to appear, so please check the information below!

**1) If the payment information is missing when signing up for Admob, no ads will be displayed.**

Please make sure that your payment information is not missing to complete your registration.

**2) You should review the ad management.**

In order for your ads to actually be published in your app, you will need to review the list of ads.

Please change the unreviewed ads to Review, and check the list of blocked ads.

After applying for Admob, please check the check method and operation precautions in the manual below.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I only need to manage ads the first time after signing up for Admob?</summary>

Of course, you should do it after you sign up, but you should check your ads from time to time.

During operation, if an ad that was initially well posted has an unreviewed line item, the ad may be dropped from the app.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there anything wrong with saying that there are no ads to review in the unreviewed ads?</summary>

Nothing will appear when there are no ads to review yet, or when all the ads have already been reviewed.

If you wait a day or so, an ad will usually be posted on the app.

If no ads are posted in the app, please go back into Admob Blocked Ad Management and check that there are no unreviewed ads.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does the Admob application not apply to webview apps and push version apps?</summary>

Yes, only apps built from generic prototypes can run admob ads.

Apps created by hanging web links intact, such as webview version and push version, cannot be admob applied.

Admob is an ad that you hang on the app.

Web apps that run as websites (webviews, push apps) must use AdSense, not Admob.

In other words, if you place a Google AdSense ad directly on the site that you can hang on the homepage, and then create a push or webview app, the app will also display the ad.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I correct the head-end impression pattern?</summary>

ex) Make the head-to-head ad pop up every 30 seconds, and make the head-end ad pop up after switching page 4

Yes you can. Banner ads have no exposure pattern, so you can only modify the full-blown ads.

Head-to-head ads can be set by modifying the impression pattern directly by the app operator.

Please modify it in the \[Admob Plugin Settings] screen to operate.

<img src="https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/%EC%95%A0%EB%93%9C%EB%AA%B9%EA%B4%91%EA%B3%A0%EB%8B%A8%EC%9C%842.png" alt="" data-size="original">

If you register for the first time, or make your first modifications, you will need to save and re-create the app.

You'll need to recreate the app in a new version to reflect the changes.

If you make subsequent modifications, just save them and they will be automatically reflected in the app. (Relaunching after the app exits reflects the changed ad pattern)

**\*Front ad impression settings**

**1)Impressions on the first launch of the app**

\-When you launch the > app for the first time, you will see an overheader.

**2) When the app first screen switch is in progress**

\-After launching the > app, select the first menu, page, etc., and once the screen is switched, a front pop-up ad will appear.

**3)Ad impressions by number of screen conversions**

\-You can set the number of ad impressions that pop up as the > screen switches.

Example)'When set to '5', the full-blown ad will be displayed when the screen is switched five times.

**4)Impressions every certain amount of time**

\->If you set a certain amount of time, after that time, you will see a full-blown ad.

Example) If you set it to 60 seconds, your ad will be shown 60 seconds after the app launches. (Impressions every 60 seconds)

</details>

<details>

<summary>I want to update an app with Admob applied, but will the Admob ads remain the same?</summary>

If you update your app, don't worry, Admob ads will still have the settings in place.

You don't need to repurchase the Admob plugin for each app update.

If you relaunch the app with a new update, the set admob will be retained.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much revenue does Admob generate?</summary>

We don't know how much advertising revenue our users have.

Since our users are running Admob themselves, we can't see how much revenue they make.

Admob generates revenue only when users click on ads that are embedded in the app.

For those who operate, the profit difference is huge, from a few hundred thousand won a month to \~ a few million won a month.

Just by starting an ad, you don't make a profit, so please consider it sufficiently.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many people need to install the app to make a profit?</summary>

Admob-operated apps have an average of 5,000 to more than 10,000 app users.

However, the revenue from the number of installers of the app is likewise unknown to us.

Some apps have more than 10,000 people, so in order to make money from Admobs, you need to drive a lot of app installations.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do you offer Admob counseling?</summary>

Admob Consultation is not available to assist you.

Our job is to only support the setting service for the App-Admob platform created by Swing2App.

However, if you have any questions related to the Admob plugin, please leave them in the inquiry and we will assist you with guidance.

After that, all aspects of ad operations and revenue must be managed by the user himself.

When applying for Admob, please check the contents and precautions on the official Google Admob site before applying.
