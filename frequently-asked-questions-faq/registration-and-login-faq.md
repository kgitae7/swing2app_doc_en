# Registration and Login FAQ

<details>

<summary>Can I change the ID (email) subscribed to on the Swing2App homepage?</summary>

Some enterprise customers may request a change in their Swing subscribed ID as their app rep changes.

Since the username change is linked to the personal information account, the user cannot change it directly.

If you make a request to the Swing2App app, we will send you a consent form to change your account, and we will be able to make the changes once we have received the necessary documents.

The password is the same as the previous one, and you can reset it to the desired password in Change your personal information after logging in.

<summary>Can I find my password or change my password when I sign up with the simple login on the homepage?</summary>

Swing2App Homepage - Easy Login is connected to the account used by Naver and Google to log in.

Therefore, the password must be verified with the account you connected to.

(If it's a Google account, please go to Google Gmail and check the account you're using)

In the Swing2App you can't find your password because you're only logged in with an account connected, and you can't change your password.

Unlike the homepage, the app doesn't have a login page dedicated to the deputy administrator.

From the login screen, you can log in with the username and password of the user designated as the deputy administrator.

Since the rating has already been changed from User to Administrator, you can see that the rating has been changed to 'Administrator' by logging in using the normal method.
