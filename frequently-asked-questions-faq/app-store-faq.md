<details>

<summary>How much does it cost to register an Apple developer account?</summary>

The 1-year subscription to the Apple developer account costs KRW 129,000.

An Apple developer account costs 1 year and must be renewed every 1 year.

If you can't pay before the expiration of the subscription period, the app will be dropped from the App Store.

(Apps that have gone down can be re-registered after paying the fee)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can the App Store register on behalf of a swing-to-app account?</summary>

Yes you can.

If it's difficult for users to create their own Apple developer account, or if the developer is incurred, they can launch your app to the App Store with a Swing2App account.

\*Google cannot register as an account proxy

When you apply for an App Store upload, please agree to the proxy registration notices registered in the application and you will register with your Swing2App account.

However, regarding proxy registration, you must check and agree to all of the following notes.

<details>

<summary>App Store Developer Name at the time of proxy registration: I am distributed under 'Swing2app Co Ltd.', can I change it?</summary>

If you register on behalf of the App Store with a Swing2App account, the name of the App Store developer will be distributed as 'Swing2app Co Ltd'.

Because you register as a swing-to-app account, you can't specify a distributor name per app.

Therefore, you should use the Swing2App development mission as it is.

**If you want users to distribute it under their preferred name, please create an Apple developer account.**

When uploading to the App Store, fill in the Apple developer account you created: Enter your ID and password and we'll upload it to that account.

The developer name naturally applies as the username.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long does the App Store take for an app to launch?</summary>

It usually takes less than a week (7 days).

However, it may take longer than the time above because Apple often refuses to review.

Please allow time to wait for the review.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I transfer my account to a Swing2App account on the App Store after the app launches?</summary>

Yes you can.

After launching with a Swing2App Developer account, if you've registered for your Apple Developer account, you can move your app to that account.

However, moving the app to that account also requires you to re-register the app, so you will need to purchase an upload ticket and apply for upload. \_(App Store upload ticket costs KRW 20,000)

In the Upload Application notebox, you can fill in the existing released app transfer request, and fill in the account:ID and password you created.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is it not officially released on the App Store and can only be used by internal employees and employees?</summary>

The App Store does not approve the official launch of in-house apps for internal use within the company and used only by employees.

This means that you can only launch apps that are available to all users on the App Store.

Therefore, if you create an app that is only available to employees within your company, it will not be available on the App Store, which can be difficult for iPhone users to use.

The only way to do this is to release your app to users who have been added using test-flight, rather than making it officially available to the App Store.

**\[How to use the App Store test-flight]** <mark style="color:blue;">https://wp.swing2app.co.kr/knowledgebase/appstore-testflight/</mark>

The method of use is the same as using a paid app.

You'll need to purchase a swing paid app pass, an app store upload ticket.

After purchasing the upload ticket, please apply for the App Store upload from the App Production History page → the App Operation → Version Management \*App Operation.

It's not an actual official release, but the test-launched app will also be available after being vetted by Apple on the App Store.

Therefore, you will need to fill in all the fields on the upload application to apply. After the application is completed, please email : help@swing2app.co.kr the App Store test-flight request email.

Please collect and send us all the Apple accounts (email addresses) of users who want to use the iPhone app.

Once inside your iPhone, you can check your Apple-ID by entering the Settings menu.

\*Your Apple Account must be sent to the final.

\*If you make any additions in the future, you will need to purchase and apply for a re-upload ticket, so we recommend that you collect and forward the email accounts of all iPhone users.

The launch of the app store test-flight app takes about 3-5 days to review.

It's sooner than an official rollout of the app, and it's almost always approved without rejection.

Once the review and approval is complete, an invit email will be sent to the iPhone users' accounts above.

Users can check the invitation email and download the app to their iPhone.

<mark style="color:red;">**\[Precautions]**</mark>

1\)The launch of the test-flight app has a 90-day service period.

Apple's policy only allows you to use it for 90 days, and if you need more access to the iPhone app, you'll need to request an App Store upload again.

We will then update the app version again to get back to work.

2\) Paid app access is also available only if it is purchased.

Even if it's not an official release, the concept of launching it on the App Store is the same, so if it's not a paid app, it won't be available and you'll be suspended.

Therefore, you should continue to maintain the paid version of the app.

3\) Apple user accounts (email addresses) must be collected when you first apply for an App Store upload.

Each subsequent invitation to a user account, you will incur a cost because you will have to re-submit the upload request for each invitation.

<summary>Can I change the name of an Apple (App Store) developer? (If you have your own Apple account)</summary>

**For Apple, you can't change the developer name after you sign up.**

Corporations can register their developer names with corporate names and individuals with English names, so they cannot be changed to other names for convenience.

**Instead , Apple can change your account from "Individual" to → "Corporation."**

Please note that you cannot change a developer's name along the way without any particular reason other than for this reason.

<summary>Why are there so many rejections when reviewing the App Store? *Refusal to review</summary>

Apple, unlike Google, has a very tricky way to vet apps. The review will be rejected for a variety of reasons. Let me tell you one of the most prominent examples of refusal to review.

1\) Metadata Policy Violation: If there is no content/content within the app, or there is sexually relevant content, images, or offensive content&#x20;

2\) Design minimum feature violation: When the app is the same as the website (if you create an app like a website, it will not be recognized as an app)&#x20;

3\) Weblink error: If you mistyped the weblink URL associated with the app and the address could not be found, or if it says it is the wrong weblink address,&#x20;

4\) Use an Apple-specific image:&#x20;

5\) Unauthorized use of copyrighted

images: If you use copyrighted images such as icons, etc., similar to the above and use copyrighted images such as brand logos and icons from other companies&#x20;

6\) Image quality: If the image is created with poor or poor quality when working with app icons, standby screen images, etc.&#x20;

7\) Require personal information to sign up: If the registration window asks for personal information such as the user's phone number&#x20;

8\) Private app: You will need to submit a demo account together to verify the contents of the app.&#x20;

The Play Store is judged by a similar policy to Apple, so please check with the Play Store as well. In addition, there are many more cases of Apple refusal to review, so please refer to the relevant post for more information.

<details>

<summary>The app that was released to the App Store and was in use went down. Why?</summary>

Apple developers, unlike Google, have a 1-year membership period. \*Google uses it for a lifetime

As a result, Apple needs to pay a developer account membership fee every 1 year to renew the subscription period.

If a well-released app has gone down, it's likely that your contract has expired.

Enter the Apple iTunes site, log in with your developer account and check the duration. <mark style="color:blue;">https://itunesconnect.apple.com</mark>

If your contract has expired, a window will appear on the main page asking you to renew your membership.

Please renew your membership on the Apple Developer website. <mark style="color:blue;">https://developer.apple.com/</mark>

\*Apple developer fee: KRW 129,000 per year

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does the App Store allow users to upload apps themselves?</summary>

The App Store doesn't allow you to upload directly even if you have an Apple developer account.

Users cannot upload directly, they can only upload on their own in Swing.

Unlike Google, Apple does not allow users to upload directly because app uploads require the developer's development source, security content related to \*\*\*\* development, etc.

Please note that it can only be uploaded by the developer (swing).

(App Store upload agency: 1 time 20,000 won)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I update an app that has been released on the App Store?</summary>

As previously described, the App Store does not allow users to upload directly, so if you have an update, you will need to re-apply for it.

**Please purchase the App Store Upload Application Ticket (1 time 20,000 KRW) and re-apply for the upload.**

Each update costs you to upload, so if you have any modifications, it's a good idea to work on them all at once.
