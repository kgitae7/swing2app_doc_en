<summary>Are push shipments unlimited? Is there a limit to the number of people?</summary>

Yes, push shipments are unlimited.

Push has **no limit to the number of dispatches and is available to an unlimited number of people.**

In addition, all the features offered by the Swing-to-App are free, so push sending is free, and you can send pushes freely.

<details>

<summary>What capacity is available to the app?</summary>

The free version and the paid version also have different capacity depending on the product used.

**\*Free version: 100MB capacity**

**\*Paid version**

1\)Basic type use ticket: 2GB capacity

2\)Expandable subscription: 10GB capacity

3\)Premium Use: 50GB of capacity

Please check the capacity provided by version and by product.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if my app is overcapacity?</summary>

If the amount of capacity provided to the app is exceeded, the app will be suspended. \*Stop after 3 days of overcapacity

Even if you use a paid app, regardless of the remaining period of use, it will be suspended if the capacity is exceeded.

Suspension of an app due to an overcapacity is the same as the expiration of the subscription period.

(See image)

**The app won't be deleted, but when you launch it, you'll get a "Your subscription has expired" message and the app won't run.**

Users who download the app from the Store will also be restricted from using the app when the message appears.

Therefore, if the capacity is exceeded, you can free up capacity by purchasing and applying a separate capacity add-on for as much capacity as you are insufficient, or by deleting the larger posts from the resource management page.

If the capacity is exceeded, we will notify you by e-mail or text.

</details>

3\. At this time, you can modify the horizontal and vertical sizes listed in the link and insert them. If you do it at 340px horizontally and 240px vertically, it will fit into your phone's screen. (Nowadays, the size of the mobile phone has increased, so even if it is 380 X 220, it fits well\~)
