Paid subscriptions are counted for days from the date of payment of the subscription.

For example, if you paid on March 4th, the period starts on the 4th of March.

So if you need to put an app on your stove, make sure you've finished building the app and then buy a paid subscription and upload ticket.

<summary>How are the days of use handled during the App Store and Play Store review period?</summary>

The App Store and Play Store review period takes about a week.

During the examination period, the number of days of use of the pass will be deducted as it is.

**Even if the app has not been released to the Store, the number of days of use will be counted because the app must operate normally during the review period.**

Therefore, we will not supplement the review period of the app.

Users may want to think about the review period in advance and use it as a way to add more tickets in time for the completion of the review.
