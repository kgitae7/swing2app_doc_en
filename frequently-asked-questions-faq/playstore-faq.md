<summary>If I apply for a PlayStore upload to the Swing-to-App app, will the app be released immediately?</summary>

We'll act on behalf of Swing-to-App and upload the app to the Play Store.

It's not going to be released right away, it's going to be reviewed by Google apps.

**Google app screening takes an average of about a week.**

**So uploading doesn't mean your app will be released right away.**

**If there are no issues after the review, it will be released to the Store after the review period (within 7 days).**

<summary>Your PlayStore app has been rejected for review. What should I do?</summary>

If you've been rejected for review of a Play Store app, you'll need to check your email from Google as to why it was rejected.

To your Google developer account, we'll send you an email informing you how to act on what policies your app violates in your email.

So if you're being rejected, check your email first to see the notice you received from Google.

Please act as stated in the e-mail and re-edit it to request an review.

Since the review was rejected, if you modify the content in question and submit it for review, you will be able to release it.

<details>

<summary>An app that was well listed on the Play Store was suddenly deleted. What should I do?</summary>

**The Play Store will periodically filter and re-screen apps that are currently in operation.**

At this time, the contents of the app are examined in great detail , so even an app that was **initially registered well may be suspended from publishing the app due to a violation of the policy or a violation of the regulations.**

Apps that have been suspended from publishing can re-register after fixing the offending item.

Usually, when an app is deleted, Google will send you an email about what content the app has violated its policies.

So you can identify and act on what is at stake.

However, there are times when action is not taken.

If the degree of policy violation is severe and Google does not restore it, the app will not be available again.

In this case, you can't re-upload an existing app, and you'll need to re-register it as a new app (app name change, package change).

</details>

<details>

<summary>What should I do if my app goes down with the Google Update policy?</summary>

Google is constantly updating its policies.

Users who have launched and are using the app on the Play Store should always check Google's update policy to update the app periodically.

If you don't modify your app to comply with our update policy, you can remove it from the Store without notice.

Action is difficult because the app is unloaded without any prior warning.

Therefore, during use, please carefully check the update and policy notification e-mail sent by Google to be proactive.

The Swing-to-App will always provide you with a plan of action in line with Google's policy changes, so if you have difficulty confirming what this is about, please leave an inquiry to the Swing-to-App website.

<details>

<summary>Your PlayStore account has been deleted. What should I do?</summary>

If you violate the rules multiple times, Google will delete your account without notice.

**\*\* Deleted app accounts can be resolved by sending an appeal email to Google.**

However, be aware that if you are sure that the policy has been violated, it will not be easy to restore it.

If your account is not restored, you can re-create a Google Developer Account and register a new app.

By creating a new account altogether, it won't work with existing apps, and you won't be able to manage existing apps.

Therefore, you should be careful to follow Google's policies and regulations to ensure that your account is not deleted as well as deleting the app.
